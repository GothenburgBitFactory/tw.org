### Triage

This is the initial assessment of an issue. The purpose is to get it moving in
the right direction and make sure it gets noticed in the right context, which
means making sure that every issue has a suitable category and version. New
issues are reported all the time, sometimes the submitter fills in fields,
sometimes not. That cannot be controlled. Everything else can.

#### Initial Assessment

-   Move the issue to the correct project. Sometimes an issue is reported as a
    Taskserver bug, but it is a sync issue with Taskwarrior.
-   Move the issue to the correct type, which means bug, feature or improvement.
    Sometimes it is not easy to distinguish, and some folks are clever about
    reporting a feature request in the form of a bug, assuming that bugs gets
    more attention than feature requests. We\'re not fooled by that.

#### Bugs

-   All bugs should have the \"Target version\" set to the current development
    effort. This reflects the need to fix as many bugs in a release as practical
    because bugs are a priority.
-   The \"To\" field should be blank. This indicates that no one is currently
    working on it.
-   \"Category\" is usually set to \"core\" unless there is a more relevant
    category.
-   \"Priority\" should be \"Normal\" unless the bug causes crashes, lack of
    functionality, or the worst possible: data corruption. Whatever the
    submitter sets priority to, reassess it, because it will not influence
    anything. Only the true nature of the bug influences priority.
-   \"Status\" should stay as \"New\".
-   \"Due date\", nope. We don\'t work that way.
-   \"Target version\" has only two alternatives. Either it is a Taskwarrior bug
    in which case the version should be the current development effort
    (\"2.4.0\"), or it refers to an external script, and should be
    \"extension\".
-   If the bug looks like a duplicate, try to find the other bug and link the
    two. It is not necessary to reject the bug. Sometimes duplicate bug reports
    contain complementary information, which is useful.
-   If the bug can be replicated, please do so, and add your finding to the
    issue. More evidence is better, and often helps to narrow down the cause.
-   If there is a clear workaround to the bug, add the information to the issue,
    so the submitter can continue to work. Helping the submitter work around the
    problem is important, because the eventual fix will take time, perhaps
    months. Always try to educate the user and don\'t forget that these issues
    are permanent and therefore searchable and useful to everyone.
-   If a bug looks like a really big problem, tell people, make a noise.

#### Features

Same as \"Bugs\" above , but with these differences:

-   \"Target version\" should always be \"BACKLOG\". This is a non-specific
    future release. Features should be cherry-picked out of the \"BACKLOG\"
    version and moved to the current development version. They should not
    default to the current development version, where we have to defer them
    constantly. It gives the wrong impression to have a giant list of features
    under the current development effort - it makes people think the next
    release is going to be huge, which is rarely the case.
