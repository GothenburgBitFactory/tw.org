### How to Report a Bug

Please report bugs and odd behavior when you see it. We don\'t necessarily know
it\'s broken, unless you tell us. A good bug description improves response time
and reduces the burden on the developers.

It helps if you first determine whether this is a known bug. To do this, you
will need to look at the current list of bugs here:

<https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/issues>

If you don\'t see the bug listed, sign up for an account at the link above, and
create a new issue. Please include the following information, as it helps us
categorize, prioritize and replicate the problem:

-   Tell us *exactly* what command you ran

-   Tell us what happened

-   Tell us what you expected to happen

-   Tell us about your installation, by running the command `task diagnostics`
    and including the output in the issue description. Notice that the
    `diagnostics` command was added specifically for reporting issues, and it
    gives us information about your operating system, libraries, compiler and so
    on. If you feel some of the information is personal, then remove that line.

-   If you need to demonstrate a problem with a screenshot, you can hide your
    private data with the `rc.obfuscate=1` configuration override:
