### Rule Patterns

Rules apply when their pattern matches the input, then the actions are
performed. Here is an example:

![](/docs/clog/images/pattern1.png){.img-responsive}

When the pattern is quoted as above, `"blue"`, then the pattern is interpreted
as a direct match, character-for-character. This means the input must contain
exactly `blue` for a match.

Alternately, a regular expression may be used, by enclising the pattern in slash
characters like `/blue/`. This is a bad example of a regular expression because
it is also simply character-for-character match. This example will likely just
run slower.

But regular expressions have capabilities that go beyond simple patterns. Here
is an example that allows for capitalization of the color names:

![](/docs/clog/images/pattern2.png){.img-responsive}

Here is a regular expression that makes sure that the word \'blue\' is a
complete word, and not merely part of a bigger word. It does this by requiring
that the \'b\' is preceded by a woâ””d boundary, and the \'e\' is followed by a
word boundary:

![](/docs/clog/images/pattern3.png){.img-responsive}

Note that regular expression can become arbitrarily complex, and correspondingly
slow. If you can use a simple pattern, it is recommended for performance
reasons.

For a full explanation of regular expression support, see your system\'s
relevant man page:
