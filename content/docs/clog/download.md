### How To Build Clog

This is for developers. Specifically those who know how to use tools, satisfy
dependencies, and want to set up a development environment. It is not
user-friendly.

You\'ll need these tools:

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [cmake](https://cmake.org)
-   make
-   C++ compiler, currently gcc 4.7+ or clang 3.3+ for full C++11 support

[]{#download}

### Downloading the Repo

The next step is to obtain the code. This means getting the released tarball.
You can download the tarball with `curl`, as an example of just one of many ways
to download the tarball.

    $ curl -L -O https://gothenburgbitfactory.org/download/clog-1.3.0.tar.gz

[]{#build}

### Building the Tarball

Expand the tarball, build Clog, and install it. This copies files into the right
place, and installs the man page.

    $ tar xzf clog-1.3.0.alpha.tar.gz
    $ cd clog-1.3.0.alpha
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release .
    ...
    $ make
    ...
    $ sudo make install
