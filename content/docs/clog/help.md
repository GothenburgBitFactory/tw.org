### Getting Help

There are three source of help for Timewarrior:

-   Man page: `$ man clog`
-   Online help that you are reading now

The recommendation is that you go to the [Online Documentation](/docs/clog) and
read all of it, in order. This will give you the most thorough explanation of
what Clog does.

The online documentation will likely always be more complete and correct, and
will be updated between releases.

When you become more familiar with Clog, you will probably refer to the man page
or built-in help, which is a more concise reference.
