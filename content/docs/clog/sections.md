### Rule Sections

Each rule belongs to a `section`. A section is just a simple grouping mechanism
so you can have multiple rules sets in one rule file. If a rules belongs to the
`default` section, then it applies when no section is specified on the command
line.

Here is an example rule file, containing two rules:

![](/docs/clog/images/section1.png){.img-responsive}

The first rule is in the \'`default`\' section, and looks for the word \'red\',
and colors it red. The second rule is in the \'`special`\' section, and also
looks for the word \'red\', and colors it as white on a red background.

Without the difference in sections, these rules conflict. Here is a
demonstration of these rules being used:

![](/docs/clog/images/section2.png){.img-responsive}

Clog is invoked four times. In the first command, no section is Ñ•pecified, so
the \'`default`\' section is used, and you can see that the word \'red\' in the
input is colored red. The second command explicitly uses the \'`default`\'
section, and the result is the same.

Next the \'`special`\' section is specified, and the corresponding rule applies,
yielding a different result.

Finally a missing section name is specified, and nothing happens.

If multiple sections are specified, then the rules are applied in that order. In
the example, the \'`default`\' section is specified before the \'`special`\'
section. Both rules apply, but because the \'`special`\' section is specifed
*last*, it takes precedence.

. When the order of sections is reversed, the other rule has precedence.
