## Hooks v2

The API defined here is the [Hooks v2] API. This API is part of the
TaskWarrior 2.4.3 release.


# Hooks v2


## Events

No change.


## Input

No change.


## Output

No change.


## Exit Status

No change.


## Interfaces

No change.


## Command Line Arguments

To support an evolving Hooks API, Taskwarrior must provide hook scripts with a
mechanism for determining which version of the Hooks API is providing the
context for the script. It is anticipated that in future versions, new events
will be added, and changes to the interfaces will occur. A hook script needs to
act according to the API version, otherwise it risks incompatibility with
Taskwarrior.

The interfaces define what is provided as standard input, and what is expected
on standard output. With `v2` there will also be command line arguments provided
to the script.

A script may take advantage of the `v2` enhancements though, to extend its
capabilities.

<table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
<tr>
  <th>Argument</th>
  <th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>api:2</code></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      The <code>2</code> specified means Hooks API <code>v2</code>.
      This will be a monotonically increasing number, as the
      Hooks API evolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only possible value for this argument is currently
      <code>2</code>, because the <code>v1</code> API does not
      provide command line arguments.
    </p>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>args:task ...</code></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      The script has read-only access to the command line that
      Taskwarrior received.
    </p>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>command:add|done|sync|...</code></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      The command Taskwarrior recognized in its command line
      arguments.
    </p>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>rc:/path/to/.taskrc</code></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      Absolute path of rc file used by Taskwarrior after all
      overrides have been applied.
    </p>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>data:/path/to/task/folder</code></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      Absolute path of folder containing Taskwarrior's *.data
      files.
    </p>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>version:x.y.z</code></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      Taskwarrior version calling the hook. Same as the one
      reported by "task --version", e.g. "2.4.3"
    </p>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

Here is a contrived example simulating how a hook script will be invoked:

     $ ~/.task/hooks/on-xxx.yyy \
        api:2 \
        args:'task rc:~/mytaskrc list' \
        command:add \
        rc:/home/foo/mytaskrc \
        data:/home/foo/.task \
        version:2.4.3 \
        <input.txt \
        >output.txt

This information can be used by the script to see that an alternate `rc` file
was specified on the command line.


## Backward Compatibility

The `v1` and `v2` API is identical, so any hook script will run unmodified in
both scenarios. This may not be true for future versions.

A script that requires `v2` but is run in a `v1` context should issue a warning
that it is not able to perform its function, but it should not fail.
