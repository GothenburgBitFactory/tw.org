title: "Taskwarrior - Durations"
---

### Durations

Taskwarrior supports duration values. In the core, durations are used directly
in one place - the `recur` attribute, used for recurring tasks. For example,
here is a recurring task that recurs every monday:

    $ task add Take out the trash due:monday recur:weekly

The value `monday` is interpreted as \'next monday\', and the value `weekly` is
interpreted as a 7-day duration.

The other place where durations are supported directly is with [UDA
attributes](/docs/udas.html) of type `duration`.

#### Relative Date

There is indirect support for durations everywhere that a date value is
expected. For example, here is a task due in two days:

    $ task add Birthday party due:2days

Whenever Taskwarrior expects a date (due date in this example) but instead finds
a duration, it is interpreted as a relative duration added to the current
date/time, in this example `now + 2days`.

#### ISO-8601 Format

ISO-8601 defines a duration format which is supported by Taskwarrior. The format
looks like this:

    P[nY][nM][nD][T[nH][nM][nS]]

The format always begins with a \'P\' (period). The date elements
(`[nY][nM][nD]`) are optional, as are the time elements (`[nH][nM][nS]`), but
there must be one element specified.

Even though the month and minute values use the character \'M\', there is no
ambiguity because of the placement of the character \'T\' which delineates date
from time elements.

Here is a list of examples:

  Example               Meaning
  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `P3D`                 Three days.
  `P1000D`              One thousand days.
  `P2M`                 Two months. This is an imprecise value.
  `P2M3D`               Two months and three days. This is an imprecise value.
  `P1Y`                 One year. This is an imprecise value.
  `P1Y3D`               One year and three days. This is an imprecise value.
  `P1Y2M`               One year and two months. This is an imprecise value.
  `P1Y2M3D`             One year, two months and three days. This is an imprecise value.
  `PT50S`               Fifty seconds.
  `PT40M`               Forty minutes.
  `PT40M50S`            Forty minutes and fifty seconds.
  `PT12H`               Twelve hours.
  `PT12H50S`            Twelve hours and fifty seconds.
  `PT12H40M`            Twelve hours and forty minutes.
  `PT12H40M50S`         Twelve hours, forty minutes and fifty seconds.
  `P1Y2M3DT12H40M50S`   One year, two months, three days, twelve hours, forty minutes and fifty seconds. This is an imprecise value.

Precise values include days, hours, minutes, seconds. Year and month are not
precise because they vary, and can only be made precise if the duration is
anchored to a known date.
