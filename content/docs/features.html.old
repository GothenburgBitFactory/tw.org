            <h3>How to Request a Feature</h3>
            <p>
              We encourage you to request features.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can submit a feature request using our
              <a href="https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/issues">issue tracking system</a>.
              Simply create an account, create an issue, and set the type to
              either 'improvement' or 'feature', at your discretion.
              But there is a little more to it than that. After all, wouldn't
              you like to see your request implemented?
            </p>

            <a name="good"></a>
            <h4>What Makes a Good Feature Request?</h4>
            <p>
              Requesting a feature is easy, but you must remember that it doesn't
              mean it will get done. It may be a simple or vague request. It may
              be a complex request that needs some analysis, and we will want to
              discuss it first. Sometimes we even go so far as to write up an
              RFC before doing any work. Here are some tips for making a good
              feature request:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Describe a compelling feature, and make us really
                  <em>want</em> it.

                  What we find most convincing is a statement that illustrates
                  what having the new feature would mean, or would enable.

                  What new things could you do if you had this feature?

                  How would you be more effective at managing tasks with this feature?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Describe how the feature might interact with existing
                  features. We prefer it when a new feature is more than simply
                  storing a new piece of data, for later retrieval - we have
                  <a href="/docs/udas.html">UDAs</a>
                  for that.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Describe any new reports that may be needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Describe who might benefit from this feature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Describe a feature that doesn't impose a cost on users that
                  choose not to use it. We want the basic usage (add, list,
                  done) to remain simple and effective.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              One thing to bear in mind is that we have a long term goal of
              simplifying the way we manage tasks, simplifying Taskwarrior, and
              improving consistency.
            </p>

            <h4>Things to Avoid</h4>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If your suggestion affects basic usage (add, list, done) then
                  it will not be implemented.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't bother inventing syntax, or coming up with an unused
                  character on your keyboard. We would much rather you put your
                  effort into thinking about the feature and the benefits.
                  Syntax is our problem. Focus on making others wonder how they
                  could possibly live without the feature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't bother suggesting features that lead Taskwarrior away
                  from its intended purpose - managing tasks. We have no
                  intention of adding time-tracking to the Taskwarrior core.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you have a suggestion that can be implemented as a hook
                  script, or add-on, please do that instead. If the result is
                  compelling enough, we may want to migrate the functionality
                  in-core, but it's not likely.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't tell us how easy something would be, or how quickly you
                  could add it. Ease of implementation has nothing to do with
                  whether an idea is good. Instead, convince everyone that the
                  idea is great.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

                <h4>A Good Example</h4>
                <p>
                  I think dependencies would be a great feature, because it
                  would help me organize tasks and know which ones I need to
                  work on first. It would also tell me which ones I cannot work
                  on now. Tasks that are depended upon could affect the 'next'
                  report, because those tasks need to be done first. Ideally a
                  task could depend on multiple other tasks. I would need to
                  both add and remove a dependency. Dependencies are a commonly
                  understood concept, and so would be useful to many users.

                  I should be allowed to use 'status' field in a report. It doesn't
                  make sense to withhold just this one field. For the sake of
                  consistency, please add this as a reportable, sortable field.

                   Why can't we just make the @ character mean .....?  How hard
