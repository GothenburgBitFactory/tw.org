# Getting Help

There are several forms of help available. All support avenues are listed at the
[Support](/support) page.

## <https://taskwarrior.org>

If you find you have any questions, you can get answers in several ways. The
website has user forums, issue tracking and online documentation, including this
tutorial.

There is also a [Command reference PDF](/download/task-latest.ref.pdf) that we
recommend you download and use. It shows all the supported commands and options
at a glance.

## FAQ

Take a look at the [FAQ](/support/faq) - you may find your question has
already been asked and answered.

## IRC \#taskwarrior on freenode

You can join the Taskwarrior IRC channel to pose questions, or join in the
discussion.

## Email

You can submit your request by email. If you have a problem, please run the
diagnostic command (below) and include that output, as it helps with the
analysis. Please also describe what you expected and what you saw.

## `task help`

There is a built in help page which summarizes commands, reports and other
details.

## `man task`

Finally, you have several man pages installed that contain all the written
documentation, including this tutorial. The main man page offers syntax and
command help.

## `man taskrc`

The taskrc page describes all the supported configuration options (and there are
many), which you can use to customize the behavior of taskwarrior.

## `man task-color`

Use of color, color rules and themes are described in the task color page.

## `man task-sync`

This page describes the various sync alternatives, with examples to help you
keep your tasks lists up to date.

## `task diagnostics`

If you find a bug, or even suspect you found a bug, please let us know. Ideally
you would send an email to <support@taskwarrior.org>, describe the problem, and
include information about your installation. The `diagnostics` command provides
the details needed to diagnose the problem.
