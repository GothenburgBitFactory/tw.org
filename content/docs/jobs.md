Job Openings
------------

With a family of Open Source projects, there is always work to be done. We need
help, in all kinds of areas, for all skill levels.

This is Open Source volunteer work. The pay is zero, but you\'ll get your hands
dirty in a set of active projects that need all different kinds of help. Perhaps
you\'re a professional with a little time here and there to donate to the
projects. Perhaps you\'re new to this, and would like to be active in Open
Source, in a friendly community where you can get lots of help, make much-needed
contributions, and maybe learn something.

We believe a lot of you would like to join in, but don\'t know where to start.
We\'ll guide you and teach you what you need. [Talk to
us](mailto:support@taskwarrior.org).

Open Source: Good for the software. Good for the résumé/c.v. Good for the soul.
