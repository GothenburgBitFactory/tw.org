# Date & Time

Taskwarrior supports date and time values.
Date fields are used to track task creation, due date, scheduled date, end date and so on, as well as providing a date type for use with [UDA](../udas/) fields.

Whichever format is used to accept and display date and time, Taskwarrior resolves it to a UTC epoch value, accurate to one second.
This is called [Unix Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), POSIX time, or Epoch time.

But you have full control over the format entered and the format displayed, and this document is a demonstration of this.

## Due Date Example

Let us begin with an example of specifying a due date when the task is created:

```
$ task add Pay the rent due:2024-01-31
```

Or adding a due date to an existing task:

```
$ task add Pay the rent
$ task 1 modify due:2024-01-31
```

Finally, removing a due date from a task:

```
$ task 1 modify due:
```

This examples uses the default `rc.dateformat`, which is `Y-M-D`, to read the date from the command line.

## rc.dateformat

The `rc.dateformat` setting allows you to specify other formats for date input.
An example is the default, `Y-M-D`, which means a date is:

- a 4-digit year ('Y')
- followed by a hyphen ('-')
- followed by a 2-digit month ('M')
- followed by a hyphen ('-')
- followed by a 2-digit day ('D')

Here are the possible elements of `rc.dateformat`:

* `m`               - 1 or 2 digit month number, eg '1', '12'
* `M`               - 2 digit month number, eg '01', '12'
* `d`               - 1 or 2 digit day of month numberÂ¸ eg '1', '12'
* `D`               - 2 digit day of month number, eg '01', '30'
* `y`               - 2 digit year, eg '12', where the century is assumed to be '20', therefore '2012'
* `Y`               - 4 digit year, eg '2015'
* `h`               - 1 or 2 digit hours, eg '1', '23'
* `H`               - 2 digit hours, eg '01', '23'
* `n`               - 1 or 2 digit minutes, eg '1', '59'
* `N`               - 2 digit minutes, eg '01', '59'
* `s`               - 1 or 2 digit seconds, eg '1', '59'
* `S`               - 2 digit seconds, eg '01', '59'
* `v`               - 1 or 2 digit week number, eg '1', '52'
* `V`               - 2 digit week number, eg '01', '52'
* `a`               - 3-character English day name abbreviation, eg 'mon', 'tue'
* `A`               - Complete English day name, eg 'monday', 'tuesday'
* `b`               - 3-character English month name abbreviation, eg 'jan', 'feb'
* `B`               - Complete English month name, eg 'january', 'february'
* Everything else   - All other format characters are taken as literals

## Including Time

Using `rc.dateformat` you can specify a date with or without elements that include time.
If your dateformat omits any time elements, then you just specify the date, and the time defaults to `00:00:00`.

An example shows this using a temporary override:

```
$ task add Pay the rent due:2015-01-01
$ task 1

Name          Value
------------- ------------------------------------------
ID            1
Description   Pay the rent
Status        Pending
Entered       2015-01-02 16:57:44 (8 seconds)
Due           2015-01-01 00:00:00
Last modified 2015-01-02 16:57:44 (8 seconds)
UUID          6eb7c4d7-6323-4ee3-bf13-63c580de3712
Urgency       9.58

$ task add Open the store due:2015-01-01T08:30:00 rc.dateformat:Y-M-DTH:N:S
$ task 2

Name          Value
------------- ------------------------------------------
ID            2
Description   Open the store
Status        Pending
Entered       2015-01-02 16:58:15 (6 seconds)
Due           2015-01-01 08:30:00
Last modified 2015-01-02 16:58:15 (6 seconds)
UUID          bc8f9b89-8dea-4dae-87e5-b320b651c25c
Urgency       9.419
```

The first task added used the default `rc.dateformat` value of `Y-M-D`.
You can see that the `due` date was recorded with time `00:00:00`.

The second task added specified an `rc.dateformat` override value of `Y-M-DTH:N:S`.
You can see that the `due` date was recorded with time `08:30:00`, as specified.

You can specify date, or date + time, but whatever you specify must match your `rc.dateformat` setting.

## Reports

The `rc.dateformat` setting is used for both specifying dates on the command line, and displaying them in reports.
Most reports allow a further override, for report-specific display formats, such as `rc.report.REPORT.dateformat`, but there are others.
See `man taskrc` for a complete list.

For display purposes, there are two additional elements:

* `j`   - 1, 2 or 3 digit day-of-year number, sometimes referred to as a Julian date, eg '1', '11', or '365'
* `J`   - 3 digit day of year number, sometimes referred to as a Julian date, eg '001', '011', or '365'

## Synonyms {{< label >}}2.4.0{{< /label >}}

In addition to formatted dates, you can use a date synonym instead:

```
$ task add Pay the rent due:eom
```

Here the synonym `eom` means 'end of the month'.
Synonyms are a useful shortcut to entering lengthy dates.
Here is the full set:

* `now`                        - Current local date and time.
* `today`                      - Current local date, with time 00:00:00.
* `sod`                        - Current local date, with time 00:00:00. Same as `today`.
* `eod`                        - Current local date, with time 23:59:59.
* `yesterday`                  - Local date for yesterday, with time 00:00:00.
* `tomorrow`                   - Local date for tomorrow, with time 00:00:00.

* `january`, `february`, ...   - Local date for the specified month, 1st day, with time 00:00:00. Can be shortened, e.g. `jan`, `feb`. {{< label >}}2.6.0{{< /label >}} Can be capitalized, e.g. `January`, `Feb`.
* `later`, `someday`           - Local 9999-12-30, with time 00:00:00. A date far away, with a meaning to GTD users.
* `soy`                        - Local date for the current year, January 1st, with time 00:00:00.
* `eoy`                        - Local date for the current year, December 31st, with time 23:59:59.

* `midsommarafton`             - Local date for the Friday after June 19th, with time 00:00:00. Swedish.

For a visual representation of some of the dates look at [Named Dates](../named_dates/).

The synonyms are supported in addition to `rc.dateformat`.

Close to every synonym also support including a modifier `n` for next or `p` for previous, such as:
* `sonw`                      - Local date for the next Monday, with time 00:00:00.
* `sopw`                      - Local date for the previous Monday, with time 00:00:00.

In order to play around with the dates and to better understand which date is which one can also use `task calc` to calculate dates.

```
$ task calc sony
```

ISO dates are comprised of standard elements:

* `YYYY`   - Only four-digit years are supported by ISO-8601, no abbreviations.
* `MM`     - Two-digit, zero-padded month numbers range from `01` to `12`.
* `DD`     - Two-digit, zero-padded day numbers range from `01` to `31`, depending on month and year.
* `Www`    - Week number `W01` is defined as the first week of the year with a Thursday in it. `W01` sometimes starts at the end of December of the previous year.
Some years range from `W01` up to `W53`
* `D`      - Day of week is 1-7, Monday-Sunday.
* `DDD`    - Day ordinal is 001 for January 1st, 365 for December 31st, or 366 in a leap year.
* `T`      - A separator between date elements and time elements.
* `Z`      - Indicates UTC time, the 'Z' means 'Zulu', a military format.
* `+/-`    - Positive offset is *East* of UTC.
             Negative offset is *West* of UTC.
* `hh`     - Two-digit, zero-padded hours, between `00` and `23`.
* `mm`     - Two-digit, zero-padded minutes, between `00` and `59`.
* `ss`     - Two-digit, zero-padded seconds, between `00` and `59`.

You can use any of the ISO formats, independent from your `rc.dateformat`
setting.
Future releases of taskwarrior will not need `rc.dateformat` for date/time input.

## Warning

It is possible to set a `dateformat` that conflicts with a built-in format, or with other parsed lex types from the command line.
Date formats are high on the lexer precedence list, and therefore able to eclipse other types.

As an example a `dateformat` of `m-d` means that this command:
```
$ task 1-5 list
```

is interpreted as this meaningless filter that always succeeds:
```
$ task 2016-01-05 list
```
