### [3]{.label .label-success} Server Start/Stop

You can now to launch the server:

    $ taskdctl start

This command launched the server as a daemon process. This command requires the
`TASKDDATA` variable. Your server is now running, and ready for syncing. Note
that to stop the server, you use:

    $ taskdctl stop

Check that your server is running by looking in the `taskd.log` file, or running
this:

    $ ps -leaf | grep taskd

[]{#interactive}

#### Interactive or Non-Daemon Server

A daemon server is typically how you would want to run Taskserver, but there may
be times when you need to run the server attached to a terminal. These two
commands are identical:

    $ taskdctl start
    $ taskd server --data $TASKDDATA --daemon

By omitting the `--daemon` option, the server remains attached to the terminal.
Then to stop the server you can enter `Ctrl-C`.

The interactive mode is really only useful for debugging, in conjunction with
TLS debug mode, like this:

    $ taskd config debug.tls 3
    $ taskd server --data $TASKDDATA
    ...

With a `debug.tls` setting that is non-zero, you see lots of security-related
diagnostic output.

[]{#systemd}

#### Configure Taskserver to run with a systemd-unit-file

You can start Taskserver using a systemd-unitfile like the following (please add
the contents of `$TASKDDATA` not the variable itself). Running the Taskserver as
root is not recommended, please add an appropriate user and group to run the
daemon with (`$TASKDUSER` and `$TASKDGROUP`).

    [Unit]
    Description=Secure server providing multi-user, multi-client access to Taskwarrior data
    Requires=network.target
    After=network.target
    Documentation=https://taskwarrior.org/docs/#taskd

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/taskd server --data $TASKDDATA
    Type=simple
    User=$TASKDUSER
    Group=$TASKDGROUP
    WorkingDirectory=$TASKDDATA
    PrivateTmp=true
    InaccessibleDirectories=/home /root /boot /opt /mnt /media
    ReadOnlyDirectories=/etc /usr

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Afterwards prepare systemd to recognise the file.

    $ cp taskd.service /etc/systemd/system
    $ systemctl daemon-reload
    $ systemctl start taskd.service
    $ systemctl status taskd.service

In case everything is running fine, enable the script to start Taskserver on
every boot.

    $ systemctl enable taskd.service
