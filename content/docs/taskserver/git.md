### [2.3]{.label .label-success} Installation

Installing Taskserver from git is a matter of cloning the git repository and
building the server.

[]{#depends}

#### Dependencies

Before building the software, you will need to satisfy the dependencies by
installing the following:

-   `git`
-   GnuTLS (likely `libgnutls-dev`, ideally version 3.2 or newer)
-   `libuuid`
-   CMake (2.8 or newer)
-   `make`
-   A C++ Compiler (GCC 4.7 or Clang 3.0 or newer)

Note that some OSes (Darwin, FreeBSD \...) include `libuuid` functionality in
libc.

You don\'t necessarily need the latest version of all components, but it is a
good idea if you can. GnuTLS is a security component, and as such, it is very
important that it is current. Using GnuTLS version 2.12.x is neither adequately
secure, nor production quality.

[]{#clone}

#### Clone

Now clone the repository like this:

    $ git clone https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskserver.git taskserver.git
    ...

::: {.alert .alert-info}
It is hightly recommended that you build the stable version. This involves
simply moving on to the next step, [\'Build\'](#build). Only under special
circumstances should you build the unstable development version.

The unstable development version is at no point guaranteed to work or even
compile. The only time it does Ñ•tabilize is right at the end of the development
cycle, and in that case, you should wait until the release, so you are running a
supported version.

The stable version is always merged to the `master` branch, which is the default
branch, so ordinarily nothing needs to be done. To build an unstable branch,
first determine which branch by looking at the available branches:

    $ cd taskd.git
    $ git branch -a
    * master
      remotes/origin/1.1.0
      remotes/origin/1.1.1
      remotes/origin/1.2.0
      remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
      remotes/origin/master

The convention we use is that `master` represents the stable release. The
numbered branches represent the latest development (1.2.0, the \'highest\'
branch number, ending in \'.0\') and a patch branch (1.1.1, ending in a non-zero
number).

Patch branches are reserved for emeergency releases, so in this example you
would choose to build 1.2.0 as the latest development branch like this:

    $ git checkout 1.2.0
    Branch 1.2.0 set up to track remote branch 1.2.0 from origin.
    Switched to a new branch '1.2.0'

    $ git submodule init
    Submodule 'src/libshared' (https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/libshared.git) registered for path 'src/libshared'

    $ git submodule update
    Cloning into 'src/libshared'...
    remote: Counting objects: 2180, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1379/1379), done.
    remote: Total 2180 (delta 1640), reused 1018 (delta 796)
    Receiving objects: 100% (2180/2180), 373.50 KiB | 244.00 KiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (1640/1640), done.
    Submodule path 'src/libshared': checked out '2b0b70d90acb9a3ff3548befab9db8beb85a0c2d'

[]{#build}

#### Build

Now build the Taskserver.

    $ cd taskd.git
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release .
    ...
    $ make
    ...

[]{#test}

#### Test

Having built the server, now build and run the unit tests. Although this is an
optional step, it is a good idea to know whether the build works on your
platform.

    $ cd test
    $ make
    ...
    $ ./run_all

    Pass:     2920
    Fail:        0
    Skipped:     0
    Runtime:     1 seconds

    $ cd ..
    $

This example shows that all 2,920 tests pass. If you see test failures, stop and
report them. Note that there are some unit tests that fail if you have not built
the latest commit. Seeing 4 test failures may mean all is well. Seeing 30
failures does not.

[]{#install}

#### Install

Now install Taskserver. This copies files into the right place, and installs man
pages.

    $ sudo make install
    ...

[]{#verify}

#### Verify

Run the `taskd` command to verify that the server is installed, and the location
is in your `$PATH`. You should see something like this:

    $ taskd

    Usage: taskd -v|--version
           taskd -h|--help
           taskd diagnostics
           taskd validate <JSON | file>
           taskd help [<command>]

    Commands run only on server:
           taskd add     [options] org   <org>
           taskd add     [options] group <org> <group>
           taskd add     [options] user  <org> <user>
           taskd config  [options] [--force] [<name> [<value>]]
           taskd init    [options]
           taskd remove  [options] org   <org>
           taskd remove  [options] group <org> <group>
           taskd remove  [options] user  <org> <user>
           taskd resume  [options] org   <org>
           taskd resume  [options] group <org> <group>
           taskd resume  [options] user  <org> <user>
           taskd server  [options] [--daemon]
           taskd status  [options]
           taskd suspend [options] org   <org>
           taskd suspend [options] group <org> <group>
           taskd suspend [options] user  <org> <user>

    Commands run remotely:
           taskd client  [options] <host:port> <file> [<file> ...]

    Common Options:
      --quiet        Turns off verbose output
      --debug        Generates debugging diagnostics
      --data <root>  Data directory, otherwise $TASKDDATA
      --NAME=VALUE   Temporary configuration override
