# [2.1] Installation

Installing Taskserver from a binary package is the simplest option, but you will need to refer to your package manager's documentation and procedures for doing this.

Take a look at the [Download](../../../download/#distributions) page for examples.
Generally there are too many package managers to make a complete list with instructions here.

Most importantly, for now, Taskserver is a new product, and there are very few packages available.
It is expected that this situation will change soon.
When it does, this page will be updated.

Meanwhile, there is installation from either git or tarball.
