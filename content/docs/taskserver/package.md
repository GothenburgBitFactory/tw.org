[]{#installation}

### [2.1]{.label .label-success} Installation

Installing Taskserver from a binary package is the simplest option, but you will
need to refer to your package manager\'s documentation and procedures for doing
this.

Take a look at the [Download](/download/#dist) page for examples. Generally
there are too many package managers to make a complete list with instructions
here.

Most importantly, for now, Taskserver is a new product, and there are very few
packages available. It is expected that this situation will change soon. When it
does, this page will be updated.

Meanwhile, there is installation from either git or tarball.
