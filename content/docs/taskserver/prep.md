[]{#prepare}

### [1]{.label .label-success} Preparation

Installing and operating a server is not a casual task. You need to prepare.

[]{#backup}

#### Backup Your Data

Let\'s reinforce a good habit and make a backup copy of your data first. Here is
a very easy way to backup your data:

    $ cd ~/.task
    $ tar czf task-backup-$(date +'%Y%m%d').tar.gz *

Now move that file somewhere safe. All software contains bugs, so make regular
backups.

[]{#machine}

#### Choose a Machine

A suitable machine to run your Taskserver is one that is always available. If
you have such a machine, or have access to a hosted machine, that is ideal.

If your machine is not continuously available, it can still be a suitable
Taskserver because the sync mechanism doesn\'t require continuous access. When a
client cannot sync, it simply accumulates local, unpropagated changes until it
can sync.

A laptop is a poor choice for a Taskserver host.

[]{#port}

#### Choose a Port

By default, Taskserver uses port 53589. You can choose any port you wish,
provided it is unused. If you choose a port number that is under 1024, then
Taskserver must run as root, which is not recommended.

[]{#user}

#### User/Group

Ideally you will create a new user and group solely to run the Taskserver. This
helps you keep the data secure from other users on the machine, as well as
controlling the privileges of Taskserver.

[]{#firewall}

#### Firewall

Depending on what devices you use to access your server, you may need to
configure the firewall to allow incoming TCP/IP traffic on your chosen port.
