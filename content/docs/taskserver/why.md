### Why Do I Need a Taskserver?

You may not need a Taskserver. You may be content with using Taskwarrior on a
single device. But if you wish to share tasks between several clients, the
Taskserver is the only option that properly syncs data.

With a Taskserver, you can share tasks between clients/devices, eliminating the
need to keep your data up to date on multiple clients, reducing data entry.

One nice side effect of using a Taskserver is an automatic backup of your tasks.

#### Why Would I Want a *Personal* Taskserver?

Setting up your own Taskserver means having complete control and privacy.

#### Hosted Taskserver Accounts

There are now hosted Taskserver accounts where you can sync your tasks without
needing to set up and maintain a personal Taskserver. See our [tools
services](/tools/#services) section.
