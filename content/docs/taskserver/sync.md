### [5]{.label .label-success} Syncing Taskwarrior

You are now ready to sync your Taskwarrior client. You will do this differently
depending on whether this is the first sync per device, or one of the many
subsequent syncs.

[]{#first}

#### First Time Sync

The first time you sync is special - the client sends all your pending tasks to
the server. This is something you should only do once. Run this:

    $ task sync init
    Please confirm that you wish to upload all your pending tasks to the Task Server (yes/no) yes
    Syncing with host.domain:53589

    Sync successful.  2 changes uploaded.

You should get an indication that tasks were uploaded, in this case 2 of them.

[]{#general}

#### General Sync

After the first time sync, you switch and just use this command:

    $ task sync
    Syncing with host.domain:53589

    Sync successful.  No changes.

This will give you feedback about what happened. Please note that it is
perfectly safe to run this command as often as you wish. Syncing is safe and
does not consume great system resources.

Note that if your client is a mobile device, a sync command may consume some of
your data usage. Act accordingly.

But it does require network connectivity, and if there is no connectivity you
will be notified. It is not a problem if a sync fails because of this, because
the next sync that works will catch up with all the changes, and do the right
merging.

Taskwarrior and Taskserver were designed to work together, and tolerate
intermittent connectivity.

[]{#reminder}

#### Sync Reminder

After you modify data locally, Taskwarrior will start notifying you that you
need to sync, after commands, like this:

    $ task project:foo list
    No matches.
    There are local changes.  Sync required.

This is just a reminder to sync. Respond with a sync, and the reminder goes
away:

    $ task sync
    Syncing with :

    Sync successful.  1 changes uploaded.

If you do not respond with a sync, then local changes accumulate unseen by other
clients. When you do eventually sync, the data will be properly propagated, so
it is a question of whether you *need* current data on the server. It is
perfectly fine to allow *weeks* to go by without a sync.
