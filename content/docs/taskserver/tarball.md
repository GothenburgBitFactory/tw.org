### [2.2]{.label .label-success} Installation

Installing Taskserver from a tarball is a matter of downloading the tarball,
extracting it, satisfying dependencies and building the server.

[]{#depends}

#### Dependencies

Before building the software, you will need to satisfy the dependencies by
installing the following:

-   GnuTLS (likely `libgnutls-dev`, ideally version 3.2 or newer)
-   `libuuid`
-   CMake (2.8 or newer)
-   `make`
-   A C++ Compiler (GCC 4.7 or Clang 3.0 or newer)

Note that some OSes (Darwin, FreeBSD \...) include `libuuid` functionality in
libc.

You don\'t necessarily need the latest version of all components, but it is a
good idea if you can. GnuTLS is a security component, and as such, it is very
important that it is current. Using GnuTLS version 2.12.x is neither adequately
secure, nor production quality.

[]{#download}

#### Download

The next step is to obtain the code. This means getting the Task Server 1.0.0
(or newer) source tarball. You should check for the latest stable release here:

<https://taskwarrior.org/download/>

You can download the tarball with `curl`, as an example of just one of many ways
to download the tarball.

    $ curl -LO https://taskwarrior.org/download/taskd-latest.tar.gz

[]{#build}

#### Build

Expand the tarball, and build the Taskserver.

    $ tar xzf taskd-latest.tar.gz
    $ cd taskd-1.1.0
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release .
    ...
    $ make
    ...

[]{#install}

#### Install

Now install Taskserver. This copies files into the right place, and installs man
pages.

    $ sudo make install
    ...

[]{#verify}

#### Verify

Run the `taskd` command to verify that the server is installed, and the location
is in your `$PATH`. You should see something like this:

    $ taskd

    Usage: taskd -v|--version
           taskd -h|--help
           taskd diagnostics
           taskd validate <JSON | file>
           taskd help [<command>]

    Commands run only on server:
           taskd add     [options] org   <org>
           taskd add     [options] group <org> <group>
           taskd add     [options] user  <org> <user>
           taskd config  [options] [--force] [<name> [<value>]]
           taskd init    [options]
           taskd remove  [options] org   <org>
           taskd remove  [options] group <org> <group>
           taskd remove  [options] user  <org> <user>
           taskd resume  [options] org   <org>
           taskd resume  [options] group <org> <group>
           taskd resume  [options] user  <org> <user>
           taskd server  [options] [--daemon]
           taskd status  [options]
           taskd suspend [options] org   <org>
           taskd suspend [options] group <org> <group>
           taskd suspend [options] user  <org> <user>

    Commands run remotely:
           taskd client  [options] <host:port> <file> [<file> ...]

    Common Options:
      --quiet        Turns off verbose output
      --debug        Generates debugging diagnostics
      --data <root>  Data directory, otherwise $TASKDDATA
      --NAME=VALUE   Temporary configuration override
