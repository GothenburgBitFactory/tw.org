            <h3>Troubleshooting Sync</h3>
            <p>
              Here is a list of problems you may encounter, with the most common
              ones listed first.

              The single most common problem has been that the
              <a href="/docs/taskserver/setup.html">Taskserver Setup Instructions</a>
              were not properly followed.  Please review the steps you took.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is always a good idea to make sure that you are using the latest
              release of Taskwarrior and Taskserver, not just because bugs are
              fixed that may help you, but also because the solutions below are
              geared toward the current releases.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you upgrade from an older release of Taskserver, you will need
              to follow the
              <a href="/docs/taskserver/upgrade.html">upgrade instructions</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>Problems</h4>
            <table class="table table-striped">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <dt>
                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>
                    You tried <code>task sync</code> but Taskwarrior showed you a task list instead
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    You have a version of Taskwarrior older than <code>2.3.0</code>,
                    which means there was no <code>sync</code> command, and
                    you are seeing a list filtered by the search term 'sync'.
                    Upgrading is the only solution.
                  </dd>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <dt>
                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>
                    You tried <code>task sync</code> and saw 'Taskwarrior was built without GnuTLS support.  Sync is not available.'
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>
                      You are using version <code>2.3.0</code> or later, but
                      the Taskwarrior binary was compiled without
                      <a href="https://www.gnutls.org">GnuTLS</a> support.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If you installed Taskwarrior using your OS's package
                      manager, you may be suffering from an out of date package.
                      Prod your OS's package maintainer for an update.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Recent releases make GnuTLS support opt-out instead of
                      opt-in, so upgrading to the latest version may help.
                      Otherwise, you will need to build Taskwarrior from the
                      <a href="/download/task-latest.tar.gz">latest source tarball</a>,
                      following the instructions in the <code>INSTALL</code> file.
                      If you are a developer, do that. If you are not, then
                      installing a development environment is probably not
                      something you want to do, in which case contact your
                      OS's package maintainer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Verify that your Taskwarrior was built with GnuTLS support
                      by running <code>task diagnostics</code>:

                      <pre>$ task diagnostics | grep libgnutls
  libgnutls: 3.3.18</pre>
                    </p>
                  </dd>

              <tr>
                <td>
                  <dt>
                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>

                  <dd>
                    <p>
                      Despite the terrible wording, this means the Taskwarrior
                      setting
                      <code>taskd.server=&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>
                      refers to a host name that cannot be seen by Taskwarrior.

                    <p>
                      Is it spelled correctly?
                      Is the domain correct?
                      Is there a valid DNS resolution for the name?
                      Is there a firewall between Taskwarrior and Taskserver that
                      is not letting through <code>&lt;port&gt;</code> traffic?
                    </p>

              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>
                  <dt>
                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>
                    Unable to use port 53589?
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>
                      By default, port <code>53589</code> is used, but whichever
                      you chose must be open on the server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If you are unable to open firewall ports, you can use an SSH
                      Tunnel to route port <code>53589</code> traffic over port
                      <code>22</code>:

                      <pre>$ ssh -L localport:dsthost:dstport user@example.com</pre>
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                      Then try:

                      <pre>task rc.taskd.server:localhost:localport</pre>
                    </p>

              </tr>

              <tr>

                    Certificate fails validation, Handshake failed
                  </dt>

                    <p>
                      There are many reasons that the TLS handshake can fail.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When you generated certificates, you modified a <code>vars</code>
                      file, in particular the <code>CN=&lt;name&gt;</code>
                      setting. That name must match the output of
                      <code>$ hostname -f</code>
                      on the server for the certificate to validate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Additionally, that name must also be used in the
                      <code>taskd.server=&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>
                      setting for Taskwarrior. Otherwise you'll need
                      <code>taskd.trust=ignore hostname</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If you are using a self-signed certificate, did you specify
                      it using the <code>taskd.ca</code> setting?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Setting <code>taskd.ciphers</code> can force the use of
                      different ciphers. Use <code>gnutls-cli --list</code> to see
                      a list of installed ciphers, and confirm that there is overlap
                      between client and server. There needs to be a cipher that
                      is available to both, otherwise they cannot communicate.
                    </p>

                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>
                    Is your certificate still valid?
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>
                      Certificates have expiration dates, and if you followed our
                      instructions, you created a certificate that is valid for
                      one year.  Check your certificate with this command:
                      <pre>$ certtool -i --infile ~/.task/&lt;YOUR NAME&gt;.cert.pem</pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If your certificate has expired, you need a new one.  You
                      may also need to regenerate expired server certificates.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Note that creating certificates that never expire is a bad
                      idea. Certificates may be compromised. A certificate that is
                      considered secure today, may not be considered secure in
                      a year. Is the key length you chose something that will
                      remain suitable in the future? Will the algorithms you
                      chose remain secure? For these reasons, choose an
                      expiration date that lets you reevaluate your choices in
                      the relatively near future.
                    </p>

                      it is imperative that you keep your GnuTLS up to date.

                    <p>
                      As with many security products, GnuTLS is maintained by a
                      responsible and quick-responding team that takes security
                      very seriously.  Benefit from their diligence by keeping
                      your GnuTLS up to date.

                    <p>
                      We have received reports of issues with older GnuTLS releases.
                      Specifically, version 2.12.20 has problems validating
                      certificates under certain conditions. Newer releases have
                      addressed memory leaks that were able to take down

            <h4>Debugging</h4>
            <p>
              You may wish to try and debug the problem yourself. You will
              probably not. But if you do, here is how.
            </p>

            <p>
              Both Taskwarrior and Taskserver have a <code>diagnostics</code>
              command, the purpose of which is to show you relevant
              troubleshooting details. Additionally it will indicate problems
              directly, for example, it will tell you if your cert/key files
              are not readable. The output from <code>diagnostics</code> is
              intended to be included in bug reports, and doing so saves you
              a lot of time, because it's the first thing we'll ask for.
            </p>

            <pre>$ task diagnostics
...
$ taskd diagnostics
...</pre>

            <p>
              Read the output of the <code>diagnostics</code> commands carefully,
              there may be several types of problems mentioned, which need to be
              addressed before going further.

              The next step would be to run the server in debug mode. First
              shutdown your Taskserver, then launch it interactively:
            </p>

            <pre>$ taskdctl stop
...
$ taskd server
...</pre>

            <p>
              You can hit <code>Ctrl-C</code> to stop this server. For highly
              verbose output, try this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ taskd server --debug --debug.tls=2
...</pre>

            <p>
              Similarly, Taskwarrior has a verbose debug mode, and debug TLS
              mode:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task rc.debug=1 rc.debug.tls=2 sync
...</pre>

            <h4>Getting Help</h4>
            <p>
              As a last resort, ask for help. But please make sure you have
              carefully reviewed your setup, and gone through the checks above
              before asking. No one wants to lead you through the steps above
              to discover that you didn't.
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll ask you to provide the <code>diagnostics</code> output
              for both Taskwarrior and Taskserver, then we're going to go
              through the steps above, because this is our checklist also.
            </p>

            <p>
              Impress us and mention the codeword 'Weasel', to prove that you
              at least read this page all the way to the end.
            </p>
