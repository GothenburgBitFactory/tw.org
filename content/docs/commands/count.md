# count

The `count` command simply counts tasks:

    $ task count
    249

By default, all tasks are counted, which includes completed, deleted and
pending. If you want to count just the pending tasks, add a filter:

    $ task status:pending count
    32

If a [context](/docs/context) is active, the `count` command obeys it.
