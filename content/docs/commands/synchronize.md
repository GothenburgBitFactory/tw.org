[]{#synchronize}

### synchronize

The `synchronize` command, which first appeared in version [2.3.0]{.label
.label-success}, connects your Taskwarrior client to a
[Taskserver](/docs/#taskd) instance, uploads local changes, downloads remote
changes, and merges the results. You can have several clients making local
changes all of which sync to a single server instance, and they will all be kept
up to date.

The Taskserver is designed to handle multiple clients that may not have
synchronized recently, all with local changes, with only temporary network
connectivity, and still do the right thing.

With a [correctly configured](/docs/taskserver/taskwarrior.html) client, adding
a task, or modifying an existing task, creates a local change that needs to be
synced. Taskwarrior will add a footnote to all output if a `synchronize` is
needed.

    $ task add Check the six hydrocoptic marzlevanes in the panametric fam
    Created task 1.

    $ task list

    There are local changes.  Sync required.

Note that this is only a local check - Taskwarrior knows about the local change,
but not any remote changes.

There is no requirement that you immediately synchronize when you see this
message, and it causes no harm to ignore it, but you may choose to, in which
case you run the `synchronize` command, commonly abbreviated to `sync`:

    $ task sync
    Syncing with foo.example.com:53589

    Sync successful.  1 changes uploaded.

This shows a successful sync, uploading our one change. If there were remote
changes to download, the message would include that. It is safe to sync as often
as you wish, although it does waste some bandwidth setting up a TLS connection
with the Taskserver.

    $ task sync
    Syncing with foo.example.com:53589

    Sync successful.  No changes.

[]{#limitations}

#### Limitations

-   Network connectivity is required in order to sync.
-   Taskwarrior must be [correctly
    configured](/docs/taskserver/taskwarrior.html) to connect to a Taskserver.
