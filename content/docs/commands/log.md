### log

The `log` command is the Ñ•ame as the [`add`](/docs/commands/add.html) command,
with one difference - the task is added in the completed state. Sometimes it is
necessary to record tasks that are already completed, if you are faithfully
tracking work. For example:

    $ task log Order the materials +home +construction

This task is immediately recorded as completed, which means it will not be
displayed on any report that shows pending tasks.

    $ task log Order the materials start:2017-02-05 end:2017-02-06

This task is immediately recorded as completed with a beginning and an ending
date.
