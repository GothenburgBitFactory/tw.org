[]{#done}

### done

The `done` command is how tasks are marked as completed.

    $ task add Paint the door
    Created task 1.

    $ task 1 done
    Completed task 1 'Paint the door'.
    Completed 1 task.

This sets the task status to `completed`, adds an `end` date and updates the
`modified` date.

[]{#enpassant}

#### En Passant

There is a feature shared by several commands, named *en passant*, which allows
further changes, above and beyond the command to be made. An example would be to
remove the `important` tag while completing a task:

    $ task 1 done -important

Here the tag removal is the *en passant* move made while completing the task.
Different kinds of modifications may be made when completing a task:

    $ task 1 done -important /teh/the/ project: +tag

One special case is that text provided *en passant* is added to the task as an
annotation:

    $ task 1 done Paint dried overnight

Here the text `Paint dried overnight` is added as an annotation.

[]{#uuid}

#### UUID

Once a task is completed, it can be referred to by its UUID, because it no
longer has an ID:

    $ task 937bb9e4-25df-42a7-a52e-bd47edb23ccd info

    Name          Value
