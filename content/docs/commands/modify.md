[]{#modify}

### modify

The `modify` command is the most direct way to change a task, for example,
replacing a description:

    $ task 1 modify This is the new description

Here a tag is added, and another removed from a task:

    $ task 1 modify -home +garden

The same change, but to several tasks:

    $ task 1 3 5-10 modify -home +garden

The same change, but to a set of tasks matching the filter:

    $ task \( project:outdoors or /planting/ \) modify -home +garden

Correcting a spelling error in a task description:

    $ task 1 modify /teh/the/

Changing just about everything about a task:

    $ task 1 modify +tag /from/to/ project:New priority:H depends:2 due:tomorrow recur:weekly New description

[]{#config}

#### Configuration

Taskwarrior has a \'bulk\' threshold, which defaults to three tasks. If you
attempt to modify more than three tasks in one command, then additional
confirmation is needed:

    $ task 1-100 modify +later
      - Tags will be set to 'later'.
    Modify task 1 'Buy a new dog collar'? (yes/no/all/quit)

The `rc.bulk` configuration setting can be modified to raise the threshold, with
a value of `0` meaning infinity. The bulk threshold is intended to protect
against commands that have an incorrect filter.

[]{#recur}

#### Recurrence

If you modify a recurring task, you will be asked whether you want the changes
propagated to the other instances:

    $ task add pay the rent recur:monthly due:2015-01-01
    $ task list

    ID R Due        Description
    -- - ---------- ------------
     2 R 2015-01-01 pay the rent
     3 R 2015-02-01 pay the rent
     4 R 2015-03-01 pay the rent
     5 R 2015-04-01 pay the rent
     6 R 2015-05-01 pay the rent
     7 R 2015-06-01 pay the rent
     8 R 2015-07-01 pay the rent
     9 R 2015-08-01 pay the rent

    $ task 2 modify /pay/Pay/
    Modifying task 2 'Pay the rent'.
    This is a recurring task.  Do you want to modify all pending recurrences of this same task? (yes/no) yes
    Modifying recurring task 2 'Pay the rent'.
    Modifying recurring task 3 'Pay the rent'.
    Modifying recurring task 4 'Pay the rent'.
    Modifying recurring task 5 'Pay the rent'.
    Modifying recurring task 6 'Pay the rent'.
    Modifying recurring task 7 'Pay the rent'.
    Modifying recurring task 8 'Pay the rent'.
    Modifying recurring task 9 'Pay the rent'.
    Modified 9 tasks.

Declining the modification will affect only the specified task.

[]{#limitations}

#### Limitations

-   When modifying tasks using a filter, it is easy to forget to limit the
    changes to just the pending tasks, requiring `status:pending` to be added to
    the filter. Otherwise it will change all completed and deleted tasks.
-   With `rc.confirmation=off`, `rc.bulk=0`, `rc.recurrence.confirmation=off`,
    and no filter, it is possible to cause great damage.
