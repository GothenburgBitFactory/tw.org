Q: How can I get completion for completed projects ?

 think that's a feature, but it actually annoys me.

When I type `task add project:xxx<TAB>`, xxx gets completed if there's an uncompleted task; however, it doesn't happen if there's no active task in the project even though it exists.

A: Read 'man taskrc' and look for the 'list.all.projects' setting.

 

Taskwarrior is highly configurable, I recommend reading the documentation whenever you have a question like this.
