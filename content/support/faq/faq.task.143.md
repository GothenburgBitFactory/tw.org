Q: Can I add an indicator for the UDA value?

Something like this

uda.<name>.<value>.indicator=U
uda.priority.H.indicator=??

A: An indicator format shows the presence or absence of data, not the presence of absence of a specific value, so to answer the question title, yes, see "{{man taskrc}}". To the specific example in the question, no.
