Q: Task with no ID

When I set in ~/.taskrc:

report.list.filter=-home
suddenly a task with no ID ('-') named 'Test' appears.

If I comment previous line this task does not appear in 'task list'. And it does not appear in 'task list -home'.

Is this a bug? I don't remember if it was me who created such task.

A: As answered via IRC, I should append 'status:pending' to my filter, which is the default behaviour. 'Test' must be and old task.

Use 'task show' to see default filters.

A: Right. Only pending tasks have IDs.
