Q: Can I command without writing "task" each time?

Hi, I just discovered Taskwarrior. If I start using this, I will likely keep a terminal window open all the time designated for it. Can I make it so that terminal window is always assumed to be in this app, so I can skip writing 'task" each time I enter a command?<Paste>

A: Just discovered the answer to my own question: tasksh
