Q: Is it possible to change the color of annotations different from rest of task?

I was wondering if it is possible at all to change the color of annotations so that they are different from the rest of the task?

For example by using something like:

color.annotation=white

Would color all the annotations white. I like being able to view annotations but I find even with the indentation they make it hard to visually parse tasks.

A: Not supported.
