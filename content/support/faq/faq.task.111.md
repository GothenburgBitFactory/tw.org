### reanimating tasks

Still new and making n00b mistakes, so I have tasks that I've incorrectly completed and deleted.

Since I can still see those tasks, I assume there's a way to reverse those states/statuses. But those fields are not available for modification even in 'edit' mode.

Note that I discovered my error later on, so the 'undo' command wouldn't do the trick.

I'm amazed to not find this as an FAQ, which makes me think I missed something very obvious.

Does

task ID mod status:pending
do the trick for you?
