Q: Can on-modify hook be triggered by a taskserver sync?

My desktop computer is almost always running, and it is successfully syncing with my taskserver and updating timewarrior via the hook script. I have all of my devices sync with the taskserver every few minutes. However, when I change active task on a device other than my desktop, timewarrior is not modified even though the active task on my desktop is. Is there an easy way to make it so that when a taskserver sync changes the active task, the "on-modify" hook is triggered in order to update timewarrior?

A: Tasks modified via sync do not trigger hooks.
This means there is no way to make this work at the moment.
There is a future plan for allowing this.

 

Note that your sync "every few minutes" means that even if this did work, Timewarrior could be "a few minutes" off.
