Q: I am trying to correct a task which I left running by deleting it, but I am getting an assertion error:

timew delete @1

timew: /home/achasen/git/timew-1.0.0/src/Datafile.cpp:111: void Datafile::deleteInterval(const Interval&): Assertion `_range.overlap (interval.range)' failed.

[1]    14876 abort (core dumped)  timew delete @1

the output of summary is:

I am also curious if there is a better mechanism for "cleaning up" tasks which I left running.

A: If the time tracking is still active, the "official" way would be

timew cancel
but

timew delete @1
should behave the same way.
