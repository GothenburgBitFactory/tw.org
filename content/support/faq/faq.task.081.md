Q: How to preserve tags when task is completed?

I'm running v2.3, compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 (packaged only had v2.2).
When tasks are added, I usually include tags.
I'd like to keep those tags associated with a task even after the task is completed (for reporting purposes).
Is this possible?  Whenever I do a "task completed", it doesn't show any tags, like this:

 

adam@perseus-vm1[~]% task 
[task long]
No matches.
adam@perseus-vm1[~]% task add "Create dominant function" pro:eng0 +dev +tools +cte 
Created task 1.
The project 'eng0' has changed.
Project 'eng0' is 0% complete (1 of 1 tasks remaining).

  Thanks!

A: Don't worry - your data is intact.
What you're seeing is that your default 'long' report and the 'completed' report show different task metadata.
You can modify these reports if you wish them to show the same columns.

Meanwhile, you can see that your tags are intact, with the 'info' report, which always shows everything.
Try this:

task ad3b5c51-8148-438c-9309-96080012f79a info
