### Is there a reason the 'next' report doesn't use +READY?

I've noticed the next report to show me tasks with dependencies (which are in the pending state, as per the filter). Though these tasks are not actionable, so should not be shown at all (they're distracting me).

I've for now changed the next report and replaced status:pending with +READY instead. Is that what I'm supposed to do?

(hint: I'm trying to do GTD here)

I think because the next report predates the READY virtual tag and scheduled attribute.

 

But there's no reason why your next report shouldn't use it.
