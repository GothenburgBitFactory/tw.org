### Q: How do I improve output readability?

You can use line breaks which allow blank lines between sort keys.
See [Report](/docs/report/#custom-reports) for details.
You can also use alternating line colors setting, which helps visually separate the tasks.

```
$ task show color.alternate
...
$ task color legend
...
```

Most color themes already support this.
