### Q: How do I control Taskwarrior through Timewarrior?

For example, if I start tracking in Timewarrior, how do I make the task active also?

Taskwarrior uses Timewarrior to track time, via a Taskwarrior hook.
You just start/stop tasks using Taskwarrior, and Timewarrior will start/stop tracking.

If you start/stop in Timewarrior, it does not control Taskwarrior.
