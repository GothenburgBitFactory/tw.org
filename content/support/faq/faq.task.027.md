### Q: How can I filter by project for the timesheet command?

As far as I can tell, `task timesheet` has no way to filter which projects are reported on.
The obvious `task proj: projname timesheet` doesn't work.

A: Sorry, the timesheet command does not support filters, and I think it should.
This would make a good feature request.
