Q: How can I sort by most recently added tasks?

I would like to sort the output of `task list` with the most recently added tasks appearing at the bottom. Is this possible?

A: Yes, try this asa one-off:

$ task rc.report.list.sort=entry+ list
To make this permanent:

$ task config report.list.sort entry+
