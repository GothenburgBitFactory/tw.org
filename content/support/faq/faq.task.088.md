### How to change the value for sow (Start of Week)

I'm using 2.4.0 and specifying due:sow results in a weekday of Sunday but I need Monday for sow

specifying weekstart in taskrc only has influence on task calendar.

Not supported.
It should be tied to the weekstart value.
That would make a good feature request.
