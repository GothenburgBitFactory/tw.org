Q: Taskserver migration

Are there any best practices in migrating a taskserver? I want to move a super smooth running taskserver from a Mac to a Raspberry Pi and I would like to do a full migration (with historical data etc.) instead of a new setup.

A: While this is not a tested formula, I would recommend:

Build taskd on the rPI, install it.
Make sure it works: taskd diag
Create a tarball of the $TASKDDATA dir on the Mac.
Keep that tarball as a backup.
Copy tarball to the rPI and unpack.
Verify permissions.
You'll need to set up permissions so that the entire data tree is read/write to the user that will launch taskd.
Set $TASKDDATA accordingly.
Launch server on rPI, check log for the presence of positive messages and lack of negative messages.
Back up the client.
Modify the taskd.server config entry to point to the rPI, and test sync.
If there are problems, it's most likely file permission, firewall or networking.
