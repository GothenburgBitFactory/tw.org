Q: What should I never, ever do?

A: Parse the data file yourself
Use Dropbox and assume that it merges tasks
Track time using Taskwarrior, until it actually supports that feature
Write a third-party script that ignores $(task --version)

A: Never ever manipulate the data files with an editor or self-written scripts and programs.

Note: I don't think that deserves a "never ever". I've modified the data files by hand (and by script) with no issues. A better qualification is "make sure you know what you're doing" and "don't complain if something breaks".
