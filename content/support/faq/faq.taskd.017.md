Q: Systemd unit file error

The unit file used to start the task server does not seem to be working correctly. When I check the status it seems to have failed. The only thing I have found online is related to having /var/tmp symlinked to /tmp of vice verca. This is not the case. Are there any suggestions to fix this problem?

Process: 467 ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/taskd server --data /home/user/task_server (code=exited, status=226/NAMESPACE)

A: If you use the unit file from this page - https://taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/control.html - make sure that you remove /home from "InaccessibleDirectories".
