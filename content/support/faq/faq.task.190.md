Q: Recurring weekly task at specific time

How can I add a recurring task at 08:00 every Tuesday? This adds the task:

    task add project:Home Washing due:tue recur:weekly

but I'd like to specify a time as well.

A: Simply put the time in the due date, and the weekly recurrence will match it:

$ task add ... due:2016-06-14T08:00 recur:weekly
