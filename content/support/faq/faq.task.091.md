### Can Taskwarrior be used as a work log? Does anyone else use it this way?

First time post here.
I've been using TW on and off for about a year.
Both the power, combined with the simplicity and speed of a CLI interface, is quite amazing to me.
I own a small managed services business, and I use it to support my business and customers.

I find that I don't always have the discipline needed to enter tasks as they arise, and frequently I complete work and then log it afterwards.
I find the log feature equal, if not greater, than 'task add."

I realized that I am essentially using TW as a daily work log / log book, where I log things as they get completed, and also annotate pending/open tasks as notes need to get captured.
So in my use case, I'm using it equally as much as a log book as I am a task management system.
(I also run a cron job to export the tasks as a weekly and monthly report posted into a web log system so that I can potentially show much customers later if need be.)

Was curious if that is a common use for others, if it's an 'appropriate' use of TW, and what others are doing in that regard.

PS - Please keep up the good work!!  And ty for the s/w!
