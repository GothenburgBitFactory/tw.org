Q: What is the difference between tags and projects?

Dear all,

I am struggling to understand the difference between tags and projects. What is the difference between the two and when to use one or the other?

Many thanks for your clarifying answers.

A: Tags are meant to be generic. You can use any textual expression as a tag.

A project is more like a category. It is treated specially in some situations as you can see by running the commands:

task project
task summary
There's nothing that prevents you from not using projects.
You could as you pointed out, use tags for projects (project-tags). Though you'd lose some of the specific behavior of project:.
