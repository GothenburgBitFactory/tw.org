Q: What are subprojects?

I see subprojects (e.g project:Mainproject.Subproject) mentioned twice in the example workflow page, but they do not seem to be documented anywhere. They also donâ€™t appear to be associated with the main project in any of the reports in my tests.
Are subprojects simply a naming convention? And they are really just a completely separate project with a . in the filename which makes it looks like there is a hierarchical structure?
Edit: Also mentioned here https://taskwarrior.org/download/tw-ubcde11.pdf

A: A project is a string.
If you use the ''.'' notation in the string, then it affects filtering.
For example, you could have these tasks:

$ task add project:Home ...
$ task add project:Home.Garden ...
$ task add project:Home.Garden.Vegetables ...
Then when you issue this filter:

$ task project:Home.Garden list
...
you will see two tasks, because the project filter performs a leftmost match.

A: In addition to xxx's answer, subtasks will also show up as indented under their Main task when running a command like `task summary`:

Home
    Garden
        Vegetables
Completing tasks in subprojects will increase the progress in the main project, so Taskwarrior indeed tracks them as part of that main project.
