Q: Filter by end/entry/modified date

Filtering tasks by due date seems to work pretty well:

task status:pending due:2014-10-02
But similar queries for `end`, `entry` or `modified` date fields don't work, e.g. if I want to get a list of all tasks that are completed and have their end date of Sept 30:

task status:completed end:2014-09-30
Any ideas how to do this? or is filtering by these date fields not supported?

A: To answer my own question:

task status:completed end:2014-09-30 all
Otherwise, we're just looking at pending tasks by default.
