Q: How to display completed time in report?

In the 'end' column of a report, it just shows the date it was done. Can this be expanded to show the actual time as well?

A: If you do "task columns end" you can see there's other formats to use in a custom version of whatever report, so, I think it is possible. I'm afraid I have not experimented with this much yet, but, this gives some more info:
