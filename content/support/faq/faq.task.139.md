### How to display completed time in report?

In the 'end' column of a report, it just shows the date it was done. Can this be expanded to show the actual time as well?

If you do "task columns end" you can see there's other formats to use in a custom version of whatever report, so, I think it is possible. I'm afraid I have not experimented with this much yet, but, this gives some more info:
