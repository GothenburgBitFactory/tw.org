Q: Is it possible to have a task recur on the last working day before the 15th every month?

I see there are named dates for due dates (such as eom for end of month, and eoww for end of work week) but is there such a thing for recurrence? Would it be possible to set up a recurring task for a paycheck on the 15th, for example. This happens the same day every month unless the 15th happens to be on a Saturday or Sunday and then it will be a day or two earlier. If I scheduled it for the 15th every month and waited until due-1d it would show up late.

If there isn't a way of doing this, is there some sort of conditional logic which might work in the config or something to build this feature in?

A: This is not currently possible, but should be added as a feature request.
