Q: Date or datetime on which a task must be performed

My question is how do I "encode" in Taskwarrior a task that must be performed on a certain date or date-time? For example, if I have a meeting at work on the 2016-28-09 12:00, how do I input this in Taskwarrior? I am aware that there is "due date" but the definition of due data is something that must be completed by a certain date, for example paying my taxes (can be done on any day before a certain day).

I am thinking of creating a new UDA to store such information, but considering Taskwarrior was designed to support GTD, and GTD supports using of calendar (and on calendar you put day or time specific tasks) I am wondering whether or not I missed something in the documentation. Thank you.

A: Have you read about the Scheduled Date?

From the documentation:

A scheduled date is different from a due date, and represents the earliest opportunity to work on a task. Let's continue with the same example above. You need to send a brithday card to Alice, but her birthday isn't until November, so it's not the kind of task that can be done in advance.

...

Tasks that have no scheduled date are considered always ready. Again, metadata drives the sophistication of your task list.
