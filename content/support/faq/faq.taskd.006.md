Q: Using easy-rsa 3 to setup the taskd PKI

Hello,

I don't really want to setup yet another PKI when I already have one for OpenVPN. As anyone tried the certs generated by easy-rsa 3 with taskd? A quick look at taskd's PKI scripts seems to hint that they would work.

A: Turns out this is perfectly possible, the only catch is to correctly specify the server fqdn when building a server certificate for taskd:

./easyrsa build-server-full taskd.example.com 
Nothing special is required to build the client certificates.
