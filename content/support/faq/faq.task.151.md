Q: Highlight task in calendar for its whole duration

I would like to highlight the whole length of a task in the calendar and not only the first day, for example the duration of a vacation:

 task add Vacation due:2017-03-19 recur:daily until:2017-03-31
Entering 'task calendar' highlights only the first date of the task as due but not the whole time range.

 

How can i highlight the whole duration from due to until of a task in the calendar?

A: Taskwarrior is not a calendar.
It does not recognize concepts like "duration".

I would recommend https://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind .
