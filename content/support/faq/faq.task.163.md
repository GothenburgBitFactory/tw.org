Q: Why can't I export all tasks?

When I try the below command to backup my tasks, nothing happens.

user@host:~$ task export test.json
[
]

No file outputted
Must I specify the exact tasks I want to export?
Is export used for backing up? Or is it better that I backup the .task folder?

A: Try

task export
alone without a filter like "test.json".


If you want to have the results in a file do a

task export > test.json
