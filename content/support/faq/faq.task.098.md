Q: How can I get list of all used tags?

task tags seems to only return list of all used tags in pending tasks.
How can I get a list that includes tags used in completed tasks ?

A: You can enable this setting to see all tags used, not just the pending ones:

$ task rc.list.all.tags:yes tags

A: Is task _tags the command you are looking for?
