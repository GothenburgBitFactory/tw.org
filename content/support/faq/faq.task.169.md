Q: Tasks that will not be done but should be remembered

In using Taskwarrior recently, I added several tasks and later decided against doing them. Normally I would just delete such a task but it would be good to remember them for future reference. I've been struggling with how to treat such tasks. I'm wondering what suggestions people might have for dealing with these tasks given I want to remember them, but don't want them to show up in the next report any more? For example, would you mark them as complete and give them a special tag? Would you, (can you), give them a special status? And so on. I am especially interested in a method that is faithful to the semantics of the Taskwarrior constructs, if that is possible of course.

A: I think you nailed it with "give them a special tag" and delete them. There's no "canceled" status, or anything like that, and you can still query them with the "all" report or the +DELETED special-tag.
