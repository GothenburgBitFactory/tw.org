Q: Can I create shorter aliases for keywords?

Is there a simple way to set my own shorthand for Taskwarrior commands and keywords?

For example, I might use pri: and pro: for priority: and project:, to let me add metadata with fewer keystrokes:

task add Buy blacklight pri:L pro:Slacking

I thought there might be built-in aliases akin to what I was looking for, but I didn't find them searching the online docs, or by running task commands and task _aliases. 

Thanks in advance! 

Edit: I found documentation for adding command aliases, but that method does not seem to work with the project: keyword. 

A: Taskwarrior already supports abbreviated commands and attributes.

Look in the task.1 man page, under "ABBREVIATION".
