Q: Does Taskwarrior support a higher time resolution than "on that day"?

For example, I have projects that are due at specific hours of the day. How can I use due: to mark this?

A: Read "man taskrc" regarding the "dateformat" setting.
If you include time in your dateformat, then you can specify time.

A: Another ways to specify a time is to use the "+" operator. For example

monday+15hours
means monday at 15:00.
