Q: Change color theme at command line?

My .taskrc specifies the color theme I use about 95% of the time.
But a couple of specific places, I need to use a different color theme.
Can that be done at the command line?  Or only in the .taskrc ?

A: Only in the .taskrc, however you can change .taskrc at the command line, or via environment variables.
