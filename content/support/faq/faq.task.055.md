Q: Change start time
Hello All, I forgot to start some tasks and therefore would like to modify the start time of those. Is it possible?

Thanks for the great work!

A: how is this with version 2.5.1 (unfortunately I cant use Timewarrior with Taskwarrior)

task 54 mod start:161213_0700
works (with dateformat yMD_HN), regardles if the stask is active or non-active, thats nice.

But `task 54 mod stop:161213_0710` does not work. How can that be done?
