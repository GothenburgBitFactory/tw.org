### Q: How do I create a traditional GTD Next Actions list?

I am looking to create a custom report that lists all pending tasks without a project and the single most urgent from each project.

The report you describe is not possible as a single custom report because it combines multiple independent filters.
It could be done as a series of separate reports (one for the project-less, one for each project), but that's not convenient.

What would be better is to instead write a script that automates all this, pulling together a list of task UUIDs and presenting one result report.
Like this:

It's a bash script, and easily modifiable.
