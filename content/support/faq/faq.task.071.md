### There is Taskjuggler integration?

Taskjuggler is a project manager that can manage resources, milestones, costs and tasks, and can also show reports in several formats (like gantt charts)

Well... Taskwarrior is good for manage task, but its project management is poor (projects works like simple tags in some tasks). But Taskjuggler has an awesome project management.

So, there is a way to integrate taskjuggler and Taskwarrior to, for example, have the tasks from a project in taskjuggler being listed in Taskwarrior? There is a plugin or something?

If it's not listed on the Tools official page it's either not known to Taskwarrior developers or it doesn't exist yet.

With that said, if you are after integration with Taskjuggler or any other tool, I suggest you start by reading the 3rd-party integration guidelines.<Paste>
