Q: What is the best way to manage appointments in Taskwarrior?

An appointment shall be characterized by a start date and time, and an optional duration.

The appointment should appear in some reports and/or calendars.

Appointments should be ordered by start date/time.

A: Even if it is pretty close: Taskwarrior is not a calendar it is a "ToDo List on Steroids".

 

Nevertheless it is possible to give tasks an due timestamp consisting of date and time. To separate it from "normal" ToDo-items I recommend setting a tag like (say) +appointment, which makes filtering pretty easy. Tasks with due dates are shown in reports and calendars and are ordered by date and time.
