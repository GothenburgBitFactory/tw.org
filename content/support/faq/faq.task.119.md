Q: Shortcut: verify latest modification?

Let's say I do:

task 1 modify due:1w
Modifying task 1 'test'.
Modified 1 task.

Now I'd like to verify my latest changes if everything is correct.

Which command would show me the task that was last one to be modified?

A: This will show you the last task added in version 2.5.0+:

$ task +LATEST
But there is no record made of the last task modified.
