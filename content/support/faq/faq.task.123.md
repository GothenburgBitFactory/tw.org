Q: Recur without until:

Hello - thank you for Taskwarrior. If I set a task to recur and set an "until:", I understand that the task will keep recurring on the assigned periodicity until that date, after which no more copies are auto-created.

What do I do if I don't want it to ever get deleted, i.e., remembering to renew some yearly license. 

Do I just not set the until: ?

A: Yes, that's correct. Recurrence templates (or any tasks for that matter) will not get auto-deleted if the 'until' attribute is not set.
