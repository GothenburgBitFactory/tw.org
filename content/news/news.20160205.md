### Taskwarrior 2.5.1 Beta Released [2016-02-05]{.small}

This release is a bug-fix, code cleanup and performance release only. There are
no new features, but the existing features all work a little more reliably, and
a lot faster.

For full details, see the ChangeLog file included in the release. The release is
immediately available as a source [tarball](/download/task-2.5.1.tar.gz).

This is a beta release, and is not recommended for stable environments.
