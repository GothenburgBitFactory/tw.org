### Taskwarrior 2.5.1 Beta Released 

This release is a bug-fix, code cleanup and performance release only.
There are no new features, but the existing features all work a little more reliably, and a lot faster.

For full details, see the ChangeLog file included in the release.
The release is immediately available as a source [tarball](../../download/task-2.5.1.tar.gz).

This is a beta release, and is not recommended for stable environments.
