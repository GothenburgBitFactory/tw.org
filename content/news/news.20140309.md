### System Status Pages [2014-03-09]{.small}

New system status pages are online, which provide up to the minute status for
the various services now online. The first is a Pingdom public report showing
system status of the bug system, git hosting, web services and others. Check
this page for outages.

The second is an operations information page from
[StatusPage.io](https://statuspage.io/) which shows status, uptime, response
time and incidents.

You\'ll find links to the new status pages in the page footer on the front page.

We would like to thank Pingdom and StatusPage.io for the generous donation of
their services.
