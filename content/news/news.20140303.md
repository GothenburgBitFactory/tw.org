### Atlassian Licences 

We have received the very generous donation of software licences from Atlassian.
This allows us to fully utilize Jira, Stash and Confluence Questions giving us high quality, integrated infrastructure, which in turn lets us focus on our goals of improving Taskwarrior and Taskserver.

The Jira and Stash products are already in full use, with Confluence Questions coming online soon.

- Jira on ~~`bug.tasktools.org`~~
- Stash on ~~`git.tasktools.org`~~

Thank you, Atlassian.
