### Atlassian Licences [2014-03-03]{.small}

We have received the very generous donation of software licences from Atlassian.
This allows us to fully utilize Jira, Stash and Confluence Questions giving us
high quality, integrated infrastructure, which in turn lets us focus on our
goals of improving Taskwarrior and Taskserver.

The Jira and Stash products are already in full use, with Confluence Questions
coming online soon.

-   Jira on ~~`bug.tasktools.org`~~
-   Stash on ~~`git.tasktools.org`~~

Thank you Atlassian.
