### Taskwarrior 2.6.2 released

Since Taskwarrior strives to be _the very best_, we are proud to announce the availability of the 2.6.2 bugfix release.
Sometimes being best also means best at releasing versions with problems that need to be fixed ðŸ™‚ and (hopefully, eventually) catching them all.
 
This bugfix-only release improves the upgrade path to 2.6.x, prevents corruption of the depends attribute when syncing, provides better support for detecting invalid write contexts and fixes a handful of small regressions introduced in our recent [2.6.0 release](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/releases/tag/v2.6.0).
The [full changelog is once again available](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/blob/f030154ef6a24c673bdb78feefd31c8f5179411f/ChangeLog) in our traditional plaintext form.
 
This is a recommended upgrade for all Taskwarrior users. [Download here](../../download/).
