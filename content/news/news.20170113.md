### FOSDEM 2017: Taskwarrior Presence [2017-01-13]{.small}

The Taskwarrior Team will be attending [FOSDEM 2017](https://fosdem.org/2017/)
on February 4th and 5th in Brussels.

There is no better opportunity to register your complaints directly and receive
your own personalized sincere apology and refund.

We should be easily recognizable: that far-away look in our eyes, logo stickers,
beer and of course, no mouse.

Find us, talk to us. We\'d love to hear what you think.
