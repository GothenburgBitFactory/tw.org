TNG Technology Consulting GmbH, of Unterf√∂hring Germany, hosted an internal event "Techday" on December 9th, which is a regular occurrence at TNG.

TNG invited Dirk Deimeke to attend and give a talk and workshop, where he discussed Taskwarrior and related projects, with a workshop that covered a lot of functionality.

TNG covered attendance expenses, and also made a generous donation to the project.

Thank you, [TNG Technology Consulting](https://www.tngtech.com)!
