### Taskserver 1.1.0 Released [2015-05-11]{.small}

After more than a year of improvements, Taskserver 1.1.0 is released.

This is a major release, with greatly improved setup, security and logging,
which make this a recommended upgrade. Changes include:

#### Configuration

-   New setup helper script, `setup_server.bash`, which interactively leads the
    whole setup and configuration process.
-   When hosting, the configured server name is no longer ignored.
-   Taskserver can now be restricted to IPv4 or IPv6.
-   New man page for `taskdctl`.
-   Server now supports a configuration setting `trust`, which can be either
    `strict` or `allow all`, and defaults to `strict`.

#### Security

-   Configurable client certificate verification.
-   Improved PKI scripts.
-   Certificate examples now use CN, and not SANs.
-   CRL certificate is now optional.
-   Added certificate verification to GnuTLS versions older than 2.9.10.

#### Features

-   The `statistics` request is now supported.
-   `validate` command will parse/validate a JSON string or file. Used for
    debugging Taskserver clients.
-   If the `trust` setting contains a bad value, the `diagnostics` command will
    indicate this, and the server will log it.
-   Can log to STDOUT when configuration setting `log` is set to \'-\'.
-   Improved `diagnostics` command output.
-   Taskserver no longer ignore the host definition.
-   Improved logging for erros, problems, data conflicts, JSON parsing \...

-   Removed linking of pthreads.

#### Miscellaneous

-   Improved I/O performance with better defaults for buffer sizes.
-   Removed support for `client.allow`/`client.deny` settings.
-   Documentation improvements.

upgrde GnuTLS before building Taskwarrior and Taskserver.
