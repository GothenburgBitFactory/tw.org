### Clog 1.2.1 Released [2015-10-12]{.small}

Clog 1.2.1 is released, due to a problem with OSX and Xcode 7.

The release is immediately available as a source tarball
[clog-1.2.1.tar.gz](https://gothenburgbitfactory.org/download/clog-1.2.1.tar.gz).

Clog is a colorized log tail utility. It can spot patterns in an input stream
and colorize or suppress the lines. It can also decorate the lines with time- or
date-stamps.
