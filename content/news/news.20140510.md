### Swiss Ubucon Taskwarrior Workshop [2014-05-10]{.small}

On Saturday May 10th 2014, Dirk Deimeke presented a Taskwarrior workshop at
[Swiss Ubucon](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SwissTeam/).

Dirk presented a live demo, with a handout PDF (which we will link here soon)
that covers every aspect including downloading, building, installing, setup,
first use, all the way to some of the more complex use cases.

Take a look at [Dirk\'s
logbook](https://www.deimeke.net/dirk/blog/index.php?/archives/3401-Taskwarrior-Workshop-Ubucon-2014-Schweiz-....html)
for details.

Dirk also previewed the new command reference shown here:
