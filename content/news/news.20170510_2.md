### BYOP MeetUp in Gothenburg [2017-05-10]{.small}

A BYOP (Bring Your Own Project) MeetUp was held in Gothenburg. We had the chance
to present FLOD2 - our own CI, and distribute Taskwarrior stickers. The MeetUp
presentation was followed by sitting together, hacking away and having a couple
of beers.
