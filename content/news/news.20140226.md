### Registrations Disabled [2014-02-26]{.small}

No new users on the Redmine site.

We have shut off the registration of users on this site. This is part of our
ongoing migration to new systems. This taskwarrior.org site content will be
replaced soon, but the URLs will not change.

All user accounts created prior to 2014-02-09 are already migrated over to the
new issue tracking system. The newer accounts will be migrated shortly. To add
bugs and feature requests please use:

<https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/issues>

We will be without forums while the new system is brought online, which may take
a little time. If you have questions, please use IRC \#taskwarrior at freenode,
or email <support@taskwarrior.org> in the meantime. We will be back online soon
with better support options.
