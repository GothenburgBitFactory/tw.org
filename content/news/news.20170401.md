### Activity Digest: March 2017 [2017-04-01]{.small}

This is an ongoing series of activity reports, published monthly, to highlight
activity in our projects. Here is what happened in March 2017. This is not a
complete list of all activity, just work that results in a non-trivial change.
For a full list, see the git history of all the projects.

#### Summary

Timewarrior bug fixes are bringing the 1.1.0 release closer. We are down to 7
open issues currently needing to be fixed.

Taskwarrior is undergoing big changes to incorporate the new recurrence
features. This leads to instability, so if anyone is using the 2.6.0 development
branch, this would be a good time to stop.

The Taskwarrior 2.6.0 branch has a `stable` tag which indicates the last commit
where all tests passed on all platforms.

The libshared project got a major update to the date and duration handling
features, fixing bugs and providing a consistent implementation for Taskwarrior
and Timewarrior to use.
