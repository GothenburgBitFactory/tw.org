### Taskwarrior 2.4.0 beta1 [2014-09-15]{.small}

Taskwarrior 2.4.0 is in beta, and available as a source ~~tarball~~.

-   Calc command `task calc '1 + 1'` Hint: it\'s \'2\', but it\'s a beta, so who
    knows? And yes, it can do more than that.
-   Enhanced DOM support `task add due:123.due`
-   Date math `task add ... due:eom wait:'due - 1week'`
-   Unicode: `task add \\u2615`
-   New command line parser. Why would you care? You wouldn\'t. But we do,
    because it lets us be creative and add more useful features.
-   Better `task show` command, that includes default values.
-   Hooks. Yeah.
-   ISO-8601 date support `task add ... due:2014-09-15T18:59:00` and about 30
    other formats too, independent of `rc.dateformat`.
-   The `task info` report now shows more \... stuff.
-   More virtual tags. That work now.
-   New localizations. Now there are eng-USA, esp-ESP, fra-FRA, ita-ITA,
    por-PRT, epo-RUS. Dolphin and Klingon next.

Tasksh 1.0.0 is also in beta, and available as a source
[tarball](/download/tasksh-latest.tar.gz). Features in tasksh include:

-   Libreadline support for command line history. So you can hit `Up-Arrow`,
    which we know you\'ve dreamed of.
-   Nothing else. Because this replaces the old one, which did nothing and also
    crashed.
-   It doesn\'t crash. Or does it? Let us know.
-   It is a separate project now, and not bundled with Taskwarrior.

Features are being planned for tasksh, and with subsequent releases you\'ll see
it grow into a useful addition. Or not. Who knows what future portends?

But seriously, we need your help and feedback testing this. It\'s a big release.

Please note that this is beta software, and not suitable for everyday use. We
welcome your feeback in the form of bug submissions, and general Questions &
Answers.
