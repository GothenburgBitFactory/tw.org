### Taskwarrior 2.4.1 Released [2015-02-16]{.small}

Taskwarrior 2.4.1 is released. Although this is a minor release, there are
significant bug fixes and Hook support improvements that make this a recommended
upgrade. Changes include:

-   New German translation
-   Hook scripts are now under much stricter control
-   More feedback and help for Hook script authors
-   The \'date.iso\' setting allows you to enable (default) or disable support
    for ISO-8601 dates. This is because some of you have \'dateformat\' settings
    that conflict
-   The \'recurrence\' setting enables (default) or disables recurring task
    instance generation
-   Can now compile with musl(libc)
-   Fixed assorted report definition problems
-   Fixed assorted color theme problems
-   Better color support in various places
-   Lots of bug fixes
