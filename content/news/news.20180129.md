### FOSDEM 2018: Taskwarrior Presence 

The Taskwarrior Team will be attending [FOSDEM 2018](https://archive.fosdem.org/2018) on February 3rd and 4th in Brussels.
This is the second annual carbon-space meetup.

What will the focus be this time?
Are we traveling all this way and meeting up to give talks and demos?
Will be sharing ideas and collaborating?
Will we be planning features and releases?

No.

This time we're all about the frites and beer.
Wasn't that the theme last time?
Yes it was.
This year we're being honest.

Spot a logo, and come talk to us.
Tell us why we're wrong.
