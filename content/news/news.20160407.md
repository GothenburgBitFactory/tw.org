### Taskwarrior running under \"Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\" [2016-04-07]{.small}

Today we could verify that Taskwarrior works out of the box under \"Bash on
Ubuntu on Windows 10\". Either by installing it via apt-get (which pulls the
regular Ubuntu package) or by compiling it. No changes needed to the source
code. You compile it as you would do it on native Ubuntu. A few tests were
failing. But no major ones. Enjoy the screenshot and enjoy the thoughts of being
able to abandon Cygwin soon, if you are using Taskwarrior on Windows.
