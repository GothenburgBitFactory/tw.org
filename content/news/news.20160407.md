### Taskwarrior running under \"Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\" 

Today we could verify that Taskwarrior works out of the box under \"Bash on Ubuntu on Windows 10\". Either by installing it via apt-get (which pulls the regular Ubuntu package) or by compiling it.
No changes needed to the source code.
You compile it as you would do it on native Ubuntu.
A few tests were failing.
But no major ones.
Enjoy the screenshot and enjoy the thoughts of being able to abandon Cygwin soon, if you are using Taskwarrior on Windows.
