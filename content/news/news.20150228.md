### Taskwarrior 2.4.1 on Cygwin 32 and 64 bit

Taskwarrior 2.4.1 is now available in binary and source package form for both Cygwin 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

This release represents the first sync-capable Taskwarrior release on the Cygwin platform.
This exposes our Cygwin users to new online services, such as:

- [Inthe.AM](https://inthe.am) - a free online task synchronization service, with client support, an iOS client, and a web interface.
- ~~`FreeCinc`~~ - a free online task synchronization service, for those who need to synchronize tasks across devices, but don't wish to maintain their own [Taskserver](/docs/#taskserver).
