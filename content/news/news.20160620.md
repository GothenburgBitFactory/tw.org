### Timewarrior 0.9.5 Alpha Release [2016-06-20]{.small}

Timewarrior 0.9.5 is in alpha! Please download and give us feedback.

Download here:\
[timew-1.0.0.tar.gz](/download/timew-1.0.0.tar.gz)\
(Edit: Updated to the beta tarball)

Online documentation here:\
[Timewarrior Documentation Home](https://timewarrior.net/docs.html)

Timewarrior is a companion to Taskwarrior, which tracks time, and then shows
reports. It is intended to replace the `timesheet` command in Taskwarrior, and
add much, much more.

As an alpha release, we hope you will download it and try it out. This is new
software, and only an alpha release, so there are lots of rough edges and
missing pieces. We are hoping for feedback, so we can guide it towards a fully
functional beta, and full release.

There are quite a few features implemented and loads more coming.
