### Timewarrior 0.9.5 Alpha Release 

Timewarrior 0.9.5 is in alpha! Please download and give us feedback.

Download here: [timew-1.0.0.tar.gz](/download/timew-1.0.0.tar.gz) (Edit: Updated to the beta tarball)

Online documentation here: [Timewarrior Documentation Home](https://timewarrior.net/docs)

Timewarrior is a companion to Taskwarrior, which tracks time, and then shows reports.
It is intended to replace the `timesheet` command in Taskwarrior, and add much, much more.

As an alpha release, we hope you will download it and try it out.
This is new software, and only an alpha release, so there are lots of rough edges and missing pieces.
We are hoping for feedback, so we can guide it towards a fully functional beta, and full release.

There are quite a few features implemented and loads more coming.
