### HELLOTUX Shirts 

We\'d like to thank [HELLOTUX](https://www.hellotux.com) for doing a fantastic job designing embroidered apparel for Taskwarrior fans.
This is the real thing - quality embroidery, not merely printed.

Please check out the [Taskwarrior section](https://www.hellotux.com/taskwarrior)
on the HELLOTUX website.

There is currently a special offer, for a very limited time:

HELLOTUX says: *\"... an offer for all the devs and fans of Taskwarrior: if you order 3 or more shirts or sweaters (one of them must be a Taskwarrior one) by this Friday (2017-03-10), we give a bonus Taskwarrior t-shirt for free.
Just write in the comment field the color (black/write) when ordering.\"*

The Taskwarrior project receives some money for each item sold.
Don\'t let this discourage you from also sending us bags of cash.

[HELLOTUX](https://www.hellotux.com) is the family business of Gábor Kum, a Linux system administrator, software developer, and Linux user since 1999. We also think he\'s a nice guy.
