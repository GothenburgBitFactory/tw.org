### HELLOTUX Shirts [2017-03-08]{.small}

We\'d like to thank [HELLOTUX](https://www.hellotux.com/) for doing a fantastic
job designing embroidered apparel for Taskwarrior fans. This is the real thing -
quality embroidery, not merely printed.

Please check out the [Taskwarrior section](https://www.hellotux.com/taskwarrior)
on the HELLOTUX website.

There is currently a special offer, for a very limited time:

HELLOTUX says: *\"\... an offer for all the devs and fans of Taskwarrior: if you
order 3 or more shirts or sweaters (one of them must be a Taskwarrior one) by
this Friday (2017-03-10), we give a bonus Taskwarrior t-shirt for free. Just
write in the comment field the color (black/write) when ordering.\"*

The Taskwarrior project receives some money for each item sold. Don\'t let this
discourage you from also sending us bags of cash.

[HELLOTUX](https://www.hellotux.com) is the family business of GÃ¡bor Kum, a
Linux system administrator, software developer, and Linux user since 1999. We
also think he\'s a nice guy.
