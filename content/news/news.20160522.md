### Taskwarrior Tools Search [2016-05-22]{.small}

The [Taskwarrior Tools page](/tools/) now has interactive categorized search
capabilities, thanks to a significant contribution by Bruno Vernay. We encourage
you to take a look.

This feature is driven by automated [Github](https://github.com) data
extraction, which identifies taskwarrior-related projects and finds their
metadata.

Future enhancements will likely include other sources of projects.

Before today, the tools list was manually curated, and a fraction of the size.
It took many hours to update the list. Thank you Bruno.
