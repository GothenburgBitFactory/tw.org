### Taskwarrior 3.0.2 Released

This patch release to Taskwarrior 3.0.0 addresses a few minor issues in the 3.0.0 release: improvements to task news, better error handling and documentation, and fixes for interactions with hooks. It also fixes an issue with the release tarball, [#3294](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/issues/3294).
