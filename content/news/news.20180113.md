### Timewarrior 1.1.0 Released [2018-01-13]{.small}

Timewarrior 1.1.0 is released. With 18 months of updates, many bugs fixed, and
new convenience features added, Timewarrior 1.1.0 is stable and ready.

Timewarrior tracks your time from the command line and generates reports. Your
data is stored locally in clear text. It integrates well with Taskwarrior.

Here are the changes in 1.1.0:

-   Taskwarrior integration hook now uses a project `Home.Garden` as a single
    tag `Home.Garden` as well as individual `Home`, `Garden` tags
-   Taskwarrior integration hook now stops the clock in more situations, such as
    deleting or waiting a task
-   The `tags` command now supports filters
-   New date names supported (see `timew help date` or `man timew`)
-   Timewarrior and Taskwarrior now use the same date handling
-   The `continue` command can resume tracking by `@id`
-   When specifying a time without a date (e.g. \'10:00am\'), the day is assumed
    to be today, and is no longer projected back in time
-   Fixed Python 3 support of the holiday/refresh script
-   Added missing man page link
-   Taskwarrior projects are now used as-is as tags, and also split on the \'.\'
    to present project hierarchy as separate tags
-   Named dates `socw`, `socm`, `socq` and `socy` are now named `sow`, `som`,
    `soq` and `soy`. Similarly the `eocw` etc are modified. The `c` is now
    implicit.
