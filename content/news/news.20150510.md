### Taskwarrior 2.4.4 Released [2015-05-10]{.small}

Taskwarrior 2.4.4 is released. Although a minor release, there are significant
bug fixes which make this a recommended upgrade. Changes include:

-   Fixed a problem where the wrong task may be updated, if GC is disabled. This
    is the primary reason for the release.
-   Fixed a problem where filters including parenthesized tags
    (`... and (+DUE or +OVERDUE)`) were incorrectly handled.
-   32-bit platform support.
-   The `obfuscate` configuration setting will hide private data, intended for
    bug reporting.
-   An early Japanese localization.
-   Several bug fixes.

For full details, see the ChangeLog file included in the release.

Please bear in mind that [GnuTLS](https://gnutls.org/) is a security product,

The release is immediately available as a source
