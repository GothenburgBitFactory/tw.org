### Services Migration [2018-02-03]{.small}

We are migrating services, and there will be a lot of changes. Here is a list of
what is happening right now:

-   We have a new support email address that should be used for all support
    requests:

    <support@gothenburgbitfactory.org>

    The old support email addresses will be forwarded while we work to change
    all references. Current source tarballs, and old releases will not be
    changed.

    The preferred mechanism to report a problem is to open a GitHub issue in the
    appropriate repository, for example:

    <https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/issues>\
    <https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskserver/issues>\
    <https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskshell/issues>\
    <https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/timewarrior/issues>\
    \... and Ñ•o on.

-   The old Confluence site at `answers.tasktools.org` has been retired. We will
    be better served by an FAQ page, which is a curated list of questions, which
    have been clarified, tested, and sometimes made for more general use.

    This mean we\'ll have an organized FAQ, with no duplication, no bugs being
    reported in the wrong place, no wrong answers being voted on, and so on.
    Additionally there will be reduced costs and administration for us.

    The [new FAQ page](https://taskwarrior.org/support/faq.html) has begun, and
    will be expanded as we work on it.

-   The Gitea instance at `git.tasktools.org` is retired. The repositories are
    all moved to:

    <https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory>

    If you have an active repository clone, either change the `.git/config`
    entry to change the remote, or reclone.

-   The Jira bug server at `bug.tasktools.org` is retired. All new issues should
    be entered at:

    <https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/issues> or
    <https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/timewarrior/issues>.

-   The preferred way to submit patches is now via Github pull request.

We expect this to be completed within a few days, but most of the changes have
already occurred.
