### Taskwarrior 2.6.0 released
  
Taskwarrior team is happy to announce the release of Taskwarrior 2.6.0, which brings a number of improvements to your favourite task management tool.
To just pick a few - writeable and configurable contexts, support for XDG Base Directory Specification, and most importantly, the ability to use emojis in your task descriptions üöÄ

We also made a number of stability and bug fixing improvements to multiple areas of TW, including parsing, display or platform compatibility.

This is also the first release which supports 64-bit timestamps (also known as Y2038 problem), hence adding tasks that will likely outlive them, barring unprecedented advances in human longevity, is something our users can now indulge in:

```
# Hopefully emojis are still cool in 2100's
$ task add ‚ù§Ô∏è Throw a party for 100th birthday of Taskwarrior ü•≥ due:2106-11-29
Created task 3.

$ task
