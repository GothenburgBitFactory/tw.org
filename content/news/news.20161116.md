### Resolving with dnsimple [2016-11-16]{.small}

Since a couple of weeks ago the resolving of our hostnames and domains is
handled via services of dnsimple. They are kindly enough to sponsor the
taskwarrior project. We will not only profit from the *developer friendly*
management console but in particular from the powerful API to handle our DNS
tasks when we move towards our new CI system *flod2*. Please check them out
under [dnsimple.com](https://dnsimple.link/resolving-taskwarrior).
