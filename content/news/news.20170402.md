### Code Repositories Moved 

The code repositories have been relocated to our new [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-US) server.

Gitea is a community managed fork of Gogs, lightweight code hosting solution written in Go and published under the MIT license.
We like all of those things.

You can browse all our repositories here: ~~`https://git.tasktools.org`~~

This means that there are several source-level packages which will temporarily have the old URL.
They will catch up.

If you are a developer with a repository clone, you'll need to update the remote to the new URLs (`task.git` and `libshared.git`), as well as modify the `.gitmodules` file.

#### Update 2018-04-18

The code repositories have been relocated to [GitHub](https://github.com).

You can browse all our repositories here: https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory
