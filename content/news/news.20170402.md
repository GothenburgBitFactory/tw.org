### Code Repositories Moved [2017-04-02]{.small}

The code repositories have been relocated to our new
[Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-US/) server.

Gitea is a community managed fork of Gogs, lightweight code hosting solution
written in Go and published under the MIT license. We like all of those things.

You can browse all our repositories here:

    https://git.tasktools.org

This means that there are several source-level packages which will temporarily
have the old URL. They will catch up.

If you are a developer with a repository clone, you\'ll need to update the
remote to the new URLs (task.git and libshared.git), as well as modify the
`.gitmodules` file.
