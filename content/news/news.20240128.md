### Taskwarrior 3.0 Nearing Completion

Taskwarrior 3.0 brings new, more reliable task-storage and sync support, based on TaskChampion.
It has been in the works for several years, and is now nearing completion.

If you are comfortable testing software that is still in development, this is a great time to test the new functionality.
Please check the [build instructions](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/blob/develop/doc/devel/contrib/development.md) as there are now additional requirements.
