### Q & A Site Launched 

The new Q & A site is live! Take a look at the site, which can be found here: ~~`https://answers.tasktools.org`~~

There is a searchable knowledge base of community-provided questions and answers.
The answers are voted and selected, good answers becomes more prominent, bad answers sink lower.
You know how it works.

As a brand-new site, the content is a little light right now, but as the questions come in, we believe this will grow into the primary resource for all those situations you need a little help with.

The ~~`https://answers.tasktools.org`~~ site is powered by [Atlassian Confluence Questions](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/questions).
