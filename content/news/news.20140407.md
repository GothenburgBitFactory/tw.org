### Q & A Site Launched [2014-04-07]{.small}

The new Q & A site is live! Take a look at the site, which can be found here:

~~`https://answers.tasktools.org`~~

There is a searchable knowledge base of community-provided questions and
answers. The answers are voted and selected, good answers becomes more
prominent, bad answers sink lower. You know how it works.

As a brand new site, the content is a little light right now, but as the
questions come in, we believe this will grow into the primary resource for all
those situations you need a little help with.

The ~~`https://answers.tasktools.org`~~ site is powered by [Atlassian Confluence
Questions](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/questions).
