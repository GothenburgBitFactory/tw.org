| 2015-01-01 | [Taskwarrior 2.4.0](/news/news.20150101) released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            | Including ISO date support,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | algebraic expressions and more.       |
| 2015-01-02 | Some people are seeing unreadable color combination in 2.4.0 color themes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            | Some contrast and color improvements were made in the 2.4.1 branch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2015-01-03 | People are finding that 2.4.0 introduces a tri-state 'taskd.trust' setting, which needs to be updated with a good value.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|            | The [troubleshooting sync](/docs/taskserver/troubleshooting-sync) docs are updated accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2015-01-03 | The Taskwarrior data anonymizer is now available for download. *Edit: The anonymizer is now replaced by* task ... rc.obfuscate:1                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2015-01-03 | The `waiting` report is broken in 2.4.0, and shows all tasks that have the waiting attribute, past or future.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2015-01-03 | People are finding that the `due.age` column used in some reports is not showing data in the future, which makes it useless. Fixed in 2.4.1.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2015-01-03 | Tomas introduces [tasklib](https://github.com/tbabej/tasklib) which provides a Python API to access Taskwarrior data.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2015-01-03 | New documentation to help developers [build](/docs/build) Taskwarrior is introduced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2015-01-04 | [New documentation](/docs/dates) listing the 47 new ISO date formats supported is added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2015-01-04 | Changes made to support building with musl (libc) in 2.4.1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2015-01-04 | A script to generate a test data file, that we could use as a common basis for checking functionality was discussed, but no one wants to do it.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2015-01-05 | The first step is take towards using modern C++11 features, where N1984 (auto type derivation) is used in one place, and implies a minimum gcc 4.4 or clang 2.9, both of which are several years old.                                                                                                             |
| 2015-01-08 | The `diag` command is improved so that it offers information when hook scripts are misnamed, or not executable.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2015-01-08 | Jens contributes a German localization for Taskwarrior, included in 2.4.1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2015-01-18 | Diagnostic and debug output is improved for authors of hook scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2015-01-19 | Renato adds support to the test framework for hook script tests. These are needed before the 2.4.1 release.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2015-01-19 | Tomas makes several useful hook scripts available from the [tools page](/tools).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2015-01-28 | Leo announces [oclaunch](https://gitlab.com/WzukW/oclaunch), which can be used to run commands at login.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2015-01-31 | Hook scripts which create additional tasks are causing problems, resulting in the hooks interface being restricted for 2.4.1. Hook scripts can no longer modify out-of-context tasks, or add arbitrary new tasks. Unit tests for hooks are introduced, which will lead to more stringent checking in Taskwarrior. |
| 2015-01-31 | Downloads for January for the 2.4.0 source tarball: 1773.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
