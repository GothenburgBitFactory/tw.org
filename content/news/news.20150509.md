### Tasksh in Homebrew [2015-05-09]{.small}

Tasksh, the Taskwarrior Shell, can now be installed using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on the Mac:

    $ brew install tasksh

This means that all three related Taskwarrior family members can now be
installed via Homebrew:

    $ brew install task
    ...
    $ brew install taskd
    ...
    $ brew install tasksh
    ...

Existing Homebrew users can obtain the formulae:

    $ brew update
    ...

Then later upgrade their Task software easily:

    $ brew upgrade
    ...
