### Tasksh in Homebrew 

Tasksh, the Taskwarrior Shell, can now be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on the Mac:

```
$ brew install tasksh
```

This means that all three related Taskwarrior family members can now be installed via Homebrew:

```
$ brew install task
...
$ brew install taskd
...
$ brew install tasksh
...
```

Existing Homebrew users can obtain the formulae:

```
$ brew update
...
```

Then later upgrade their Task software easily:

```
$ brew upgrade
...
```
