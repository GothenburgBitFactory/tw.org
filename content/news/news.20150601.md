### Activity Digest: May 2015 

This is an ongoing series of activity reports, published monthly, to highlight activity in the Taskwarrior project.
Here is what happened in May 2015.

| Date       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | 2015-05-02 | Taskwarrior and Taskserver learned how to lock files the POSIX way, instead of a platform-specific implementation. This should have happened years ago. Moving on...                                                                                                  |
 | 2015-05-02 | The \'Taskwarrior\' name was standardized throughout the code. Something you would think had happened a long time ago.                                                                                                                                                |
 | 2015-05-02 | Taskserver no longer misleads when asked to modify a configuration setting with a read-only config file.                                                                                                                                                              |
 | 2015-05-02 | Taskserver can now restrict itself to the IPv4 or IPv6 protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
 | 2015-05-02 | Taskserver inherited Taskwarrior\'s `l10n` utility, and finds unused strings.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
 | 2015-05-03 | Taskwarrior documentation interchangeably used ambiguous terms to describe sync server configuration.                                                                                                                                                                 |
 | 2015-05-04 | A problem was found, then fixed, with some write commands, when GC (Garbage Collection) was manually shut off. Although a bug, don\'t turn off GC. It has been harming the bee populations. This should help.                                                         |
 | 2015-05-04 | Taskserver now recognizes libc++ memory errors. It doesn\'t do anything about it, but at least it knows what\'s happening.                                                                                                                                            |
 | 2015-05-04 | Taskserver 1.1.0 beta1 was released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
 | 2015-05-04 | The fish completion script is improved. Yes, fish is a real shell name.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
 | 2015-05-05 | The `setup_server.bash` script is significantly improved for correctness and usability. It was much needed.                                                                                                                                                           |
 | 2015-05-06 | The Taskwarrior test suite is now parallelized, and runs in far less time than before. On some systems, `./run_all --fast` now runs in around 20 seconds.                                                                                                             |
 | 2015-05-09 | Some old bugs are closed, because they were fixed a while ago, but not recorded.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
 | 2015-05-09 | Taskwarrior lexer is improved to better detect tags on the command line when there is preceding text, like `(+tag)`.                                                                                                                                                  |
 | 2015-05-10 | Example export scripts were not properly handling UTF-8, and were fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
 | 2015-05-10 | Taskwarrior 2.4.4 was [released](/news/news.20150510).                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
 | 2015-05-11 | Taskserver 1.1.0 was [released](/news/news.20150511).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
 | 2015-05-13 | Taskserver learns to listen on `::`, which means dual IPv4/IPv6 localhost. Obviously.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
 | 2015-05-14 | Taskserver learns to not fail silently on signal handler errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
 | 2015-05-23 | Tasksh lost its rudimentary `context` feature, which was eclipsed by a much more powerful Taskwarrior equivalent.                                                                                                                                                     |
 | 2015-05-24 | Taskwarrior, Taskserver and Tasksh start using C++11 N1984 and N2672, and it feels oh, so good.                                                                                                                                                                       |
 | 2015-05-24 | Through the power of copy/paste, Taskserver fixes bugs by inheriting fixed code from Taskwarrior.                                                                                                                                                                     |
 | 2015-05-24 | Taskwarrior implements an experimental, recursive, O(N\^2) urgency inheritance algorithm that may cause your lights to dim and power utility bills to increase. It may also be killing the bee populations.                                                           |
 | 2015-05-24 | Tasksh is getting a `review` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
 | 2015-05-25 | Taskwarrior and Taskserver combined `Path`, `File` and `Directory` classes into one source file and test program named `FS`. While this has no benefit at all (you\'re welcome users!) it keeps the three together, as they are a hierarchy and cannot operate alone. |
 | 2015-05-25 | Test suite now better differentiate between tests that pass and tests that are skipped. It\'s important.                                                                                                                                                              |
 | 2015-05-25 | Taskwarrior can now import tasks from STDIN if `-` is specified as the input file. Or if nothing is specified.                                                                                                                                                        |
 | 2015-05-25 | Taskwarrior now has a `test/README` document that defines how unit tests should be written, in a desperate attempt to get more tests.                                                                                                                                 |
 | 2015-05-28 | The test suite learns how to intrinsically support export. For the bees.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
 | 2015-05-29 | Taskwarrior `import` can now `add` or `update` a task as appropriate. Finally.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
 | 2015-05-31 | Task `modify` code got refactored nicely, which makes it easier for the developers to look at without convulsions. You\'re welcome users!                                                                                                                             |
 | 2015-05-31 | Some Taskwarrior code that was commented out a long time ago, that we subsequently forgot the intent thereof, was quietly and shamefully deleted.                                                                                                                     |
