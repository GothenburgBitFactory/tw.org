### FreeCinc Shutting Down

FreeCinc has long hosted a Taskwarrior sync server (taskd).
However, the service will be [shutting down in February](https://github.com/freecinc/freecinc-issues/issues/20).
The linked issue describes the reasons for this change.

If you are a user of FreeCinc, please feel free to get in touch via [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/discussions) with any questions.
