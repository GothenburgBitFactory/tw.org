### Activity Digest: August 2016 

This is an ongoing series of activity reports, published monthly, to highlight activity in our projects.
Here is what happened in August 2016. This is not a complete list of all activity, just work that results in a non-trivial change.
For a full list, see the git history of all the projects.

#### Summary

August saw a lot of documentation updates and preparation for the release of Timewarrior 1.0.0 and FrOSCon 2016.
Focus then shifted to finishing up Tasksh 1.1.0 work.
