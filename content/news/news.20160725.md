Timewarrior is a companion to Taskwarrior, which tracks time, and then shows reports.
It is intended to replace the `timesheet` command in Taskwarrior, and add much, much more.

As a beta release, we hope you will download it and try it out.
While Timewarrior has all its 1.0-level features, it likely still has a few bugs, and the purpose of the beta release is to find and fix those.
Your feedback will help us prepare Timewarrior for full release.
