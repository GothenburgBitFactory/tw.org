### Cygwin Package Maintainer Needed [2015-11-01]{.small}

We're looking for someone to assume the responsibility of packaging Taskwarrior
etc for Cygwin.

Cygwin doesn't get the care and attention from us that it should. We often skip
releasing on Cygwin because we don't have the equipment and must borrow it, and
furthermore don't use Cygwin day to day, so every package update involves a full
install, and it takes hours.

The folks who do rely on and enjoy Cygwin deserve timely updates for every
release. Can you do a better job that we have? Know someone who can? Please
[contact us](mailto:support@taskwarrior.org).
