### Taskwarrior Workflow Study [2016-02-09]{.small}

Taskwarrior aims to provide a toolkit of various capabilities, which can be
cherry-picked to support many custom methodologies.

We have learned over the years that everyone uses it differently, and for
different things. There is a lot to be learned from how someone uses software,
the features they use, and the ones they do not.

So we are asking you to tell us how you use Taskwarrior, what for, which
features, but more importantly *why* your choices make sense to you. If you can
take a few minutes, please send a summary to <support@gothenburgbitfactory.org>
and we\'ll put it online with the others. Who knows what will emerge from this.

Here are the first few workflow details. Clearly we have not learned what
questions are important yet, or how to present the information, but this will
change.

Please tell us your workflow. It\'s alsmost certain that you have something
unique to share.
