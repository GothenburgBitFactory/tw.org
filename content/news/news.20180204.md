### 2018 Plans [2018-02-04]{.small}

We have made good use of beer time at FOSDEM to lay out our plans for 2018. Here
is what we are doing, starting immediately in most cases.

#### Taskserver 1.2.0 Release

The Taskserver 1.2.0 effort is overdue for release. The one issue that has been
holding us back is a recurrence duplication bug, and we will be addressing that
in a Taskwarrior release, not a Taskserver release.

#### Taskwarrior 2.5.2 Release

Taskwarrior has accumulated a series of small features and bug fixes and these
will be released as 2.5.2 soon. The recurrence changes will not be included.

#### Migrate Taskserver Guides online

We have two high-quality guides to help Taskserver users:

[Taskserver Setup
Guide](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/guides/blob/master/taskserver-setup/taskserver-setup.pdf)\
[Taskserver Troubleshooting
Guide](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/guides/blob/master/taskserver-troubleshooting/taskserver-troubleshooting.pdf)

These will be moved online, probably using GitPitch.

#### Timewarrior 1.2.0 begins

First steps are a code overhaul so the internal APIs reflect current usage and
plans, and creation of documentation.

#### Flod in containers

The Flod build servers are migrating to containers, giving us a greater
diversity of test platforms. Currently we need continuously operating VMs to
provide this.

#### Blog Postings

Interleaved with the existing occasional news articles, we will begin adding
blog posts where we can discuss \... anything. Because we can.

#### Migrate all web sites to use Markdown

All websites will migrate to using a Markdown system, simplifying updates and
making use of templates.

#### Migrate off Jira

We will move from a self-hosted Jira system to Github issues.

#### Taskwarrior Recurrence Overhaul

After the 2.5.2 release, the recurrence overhaul will create data
incompatibilities, and therefore will be released as Taskwarrior 3.0.0,
following the semantic versioning model.

#### Taskwarrior Rules

Taskwarrior rules will likely be part of the 3.1.0 release. This will be the
release that brings a dramatic feature and configurability explosion.
