### Timewarrior 1.1.1 Released [2018-02-03]{.small}

Timewarrior 1.1.1 is released. This is a bug fix release and we recommend that
everyone upgrade to 1.1.1.

There is one bug fix in this release, and it\'s an important one that fixes a
long-standing problem that has been there from the begining.

The problem is when a tracked interval spans an exclu—ïion, the recorded interval
has only one start and end time, and the exclusion is subtracted from this
interval, resulting in multiple interval elements.

While this works, it does mean that if you change your exclusion configuration,
then the data from before this change is interpreted as though it was after this
change, and therefore wrong.

The new behavior correctly subtracts the exclusion as soon as the interval ends,
and therefore the recorded data represents the exclusion configuration active at
the time.

There is a script prepared that will fix your timewarrior data, and the download
and description is found on the [DB Correction
Script](https://timewarrior.net/docs/dbcorrection.html) page.

The release is immediately available as a source
[tarball](/download/timew-1.1.1.tar.gz). Binary packages for your OS may appear
soon.
