### Taskwarrior 2.4.3 Released [2015-04-19]{.small}

User Defined Attributes ([UDAs](/docs/udas.html)) have been enhanced so that
type `string` attributes may now designate the sort order of allowed values.
This enhancement permits the migration of the `priority` attribute to a UDA.
This means you may now define your own priority levels, sorting and urgency
coefficients.

Although it may appear otherwise, there is no new monthly release cycle, it\'s
all a coincidence. The next release will likely take a little longer as we shift
focus to Taskserver improvements.

Although this is a minor release, there are significant bug fixes and new
features make this a recommended upgrade. Changes include:

-   [Hooks API v2](/docs/hooks2.html), which is backwards compatible with v1.
    This allows hooks to be more aware of the context in which they are run.
-   Default values no longer are applied to recurring tasks.
-   Default values no longer are applied to synced tasks.
-   UDA sorting order can be defined.
-   Priority attribute gone, replaced by a default UDA configuration.
-   Command line lexer bugs fixed, which caused a hang.
-   Urgency improvements for tasks with dependencies, which were repoting bad
    values.
-   The `isnt` and `not` attribute modifiers were mapped to hte wrong operator.
-   Invalid IDs were displayed after a `done` or `delete` command.
-   Example export scripts have been updated so they work again.
-   The `summary` report can now be configured to show old projects, not just
    current ones.
-   The `info` report failed to show negative urgency values.
-   Added a new `rc.bulk` value (0) that is interpreted as infinity.
-   Minor command line parser improvements.
-   Minor command performance improvements.
-   Documentation improvements.
-   Several bug fixes.
