### Activity Digest: February 2017 

This is an ongoing series of activity reports, published monthly, to highlight activity in our projects.
Here is what happened in February 2017. This is not a complete list of all activity, just work that results in a non-trivial change.
For a full list, see the git history of all the projects.

#### Summary

[The team attended FOSDEM](/news/news.20170208) in Brussels, all meeting for the first time.
No one was hurt.
Although we had hoped to accomplish a lot during this time, we instead fell in love with a certain restaurant and Belgian beer.

We would like to welcome Thomas Lauf, who is now pushing to the Timewarrior repository, and Timewarrior is now being fixed and improved at a much faster rate.
Welcome, Thomas.

The flod2 CI system is coming online, which means that Taskwarrior is now being built in parallel by two CI systems as we prepare for a more general transition.

- ~~Taskwarrior 2.6.0 on Flod~~

A generous donation from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) is making this possible.

|            | - FOSDEM: Team immediately recognizes the importance of hotel meeting spaces that include large tables.

Team is pleasantly surprised when people recognize the logo on our clothing/laptops and say nice things to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                             |
|            | - FOSDEM: Team returns to same restaurant, displaying the kind of creativity you\'ve come to expect from us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2017-02-05 | - Tasksh: the `_reviewed` report now defaults to 6 days, rather than 7 days, to ensure weekly review as the default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|            | - FOSDEM: Fixed an odd C++ syntax error that only affected a few platforms: `auto infix {true};` which clearly wasn\'t uniformly supported. During a FOSDEM break, in the cafeteria, we created a new Flod2 build satellite for CentOS 7.3, provisioned the VM, and debugged. Three people sharing two laptops extended a CI system on another continent, while drinking some very good coffee, surrounded by our fellow attendees, all doing the same thing. This is why we love conferences. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
