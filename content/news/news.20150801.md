### Activity Digest: July 2015 [2015-08-01]{.small}

This is an ongoing series of activity reports, published monthly, to highlight
activity in the Taskwarrior project. Here is what happened in July 2015.

This is not a complete list of all activity, just work that results in a
non-trivial change. For a full list, see the [full Git
history](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/commits/v2.5.0).

:::
:::
:::

-   Task: C++ unit tests now produce the same colorful output in TTY mode as the
    Python tests.
-   Task: The notion of \'ambiguity\' was dropped from Lexer, Eval, calc. It is
    no longer needed.
-   Flod: \'Prevent collapsible links to jump to top of page\' fixed

[2015-07-03]{.small}

-   Task: Test assumed that if /foo/ appears in the output, all is well, but
    there is a false positive case where \'foo\' is also in the path name of
    unrelated output.
-   Task: TAP: Show name of file containing the test(s)
-   Task: TAP: Don\'t show `__main__` in output if description is undefined
-   Task: TAP: self.t() single-arg call now propagated to self.t.runError()
-   Task: `json.array` now defaults to `on`, which means `export` works
    out-of-the-box with all JSON parser

[2015-07-04]{.small}

-   Task: Lexer added look-behind rules to improve tag recognition
-   Task: Lexer uses maximal matching for `pair` args
-   Task: Oops, restored `YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ` and `YYYYMMDDThhmmss` ISO form
    support, which should not have been removed
-   Task: Lexer learned that when there are two `--` separators, the second one
    is a literal `--`, not a separator

[2015-07-05]{.small}

-   Task: Lexer dropped support for UUID lists
-   Task: ISO8601 date parsing added range checking, preventing `25` as an hour,
    for example
-   Task: CLI2 refactoring removed lots of code and bugs

[2015-07-06]{.small}

-   Task: Lexer learned to decompose `pair` arguments into their components, for
    example `name.not:value` has a name, an attribute modifier, a separator `:`
    and a value
-   Task: CLI2 no longer attempts to canonicalize everything, just most things
-   Task: Lexer learned how to read UTF8 words out of strings, taking into
    consideration quotes, escaped characters and `U+NNNN`, `\uNNNN` Unicode
    sequences
-   Task: Fixed zsh completion autoload function boilerplate
-   Task: The `_tags` helper command now also shows virtual tags

[2015-07-07]{.small}

-   Task: The test suite now supports Python3 in addition to Python2.7

[2015-07-10]{.small}

-   Task: All `<name>:<value>` pairs now support escapes, quotes and Unicode
    escapes for `<value>`
-   Clog: \'Blank input lines are silently eaten\' fixed

[2015-07-11]{.small}

-   Task: Recurring template tasks are no longer include in the `+OVERDUE`
    virtual tag
-   Task: With patterns `/pattern/` and substitutions `/from/to/[g]`, there is
    now the possibility of added other flags than `g` at the end
-   Task: Removed a performance shortcut fir fixed-width columns that was
    preventing `print.empty.columns` from working on indicator columns

[2015-07-12]{.small}

-   Task: New command `_unique` queries unique values from the specified
    attribute, which will ultimately replace several helper functions
