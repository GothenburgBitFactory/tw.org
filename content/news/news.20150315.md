### Taskwarrior 2.4.2 Released [2015-03-15]{.small}

Taskwarrior 2.4.2 is released. This is primarily a bug fix release to address a
bad hook problem that prevented on-modify hooks from modifying tasks.

Additionally the new `context` command is included, as are updated themes with
higher contrast. Although this is a minor release, there are significant bug
fixes and new features make this a recommended upgrade. Changes include:

-   New `context` command. See the [online documentation](/docs/context.html)
    for full details.
-   Theme fixes, eliminating the very low contrast problems reported
-   Minor built-in report changes
-   Assorted color fixes
-   Recur column now properly suppressed when there is no data
-   UDA values now accessible via DOM reference
-   Fixed some code that was not UTF8-aware
-   Removed pthreads linkage
-   Fixed hooks problem
-   `info` command now shows virtual tags
-   Several bug fixes

For full details, see the ChangeLog file included in the release.
