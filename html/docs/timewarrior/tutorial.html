            <h3>Timewarrior Tutorial</h3>
            <p>
              This tutorial assumes you have installed Timewarrior.
              If not, follow these
              <a href="/docs/timewarrior/download.html">download and build instructions</a>.

              This is a lengthy and detailed tutorial. If you wish to learn about
              Timewarrior in depth, this is the place.  If you prefer your
              information in smaller pieces, use the
              <a href="/docs/timewarrior/index.html">online docs</a>.
            </p>

            <a name="setup"></a>
            <h4>Setup</h4>
            <p>
              As a new Timewarrior user, there is no configuration needed. Once
              you have installed the software, the first time you run it, a
              data/configuration directory is created for you if necessary, and
              if you allow this action.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial1.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              You are told that there is no active time tracking, and that's
              right, because we've done nothing yet.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial2.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              By default a <code>.timewarrior</code> directory is created in
              your home directory, and contains a sub-directory for data, and
              another for extensions. There is also an empty configuration file
              created. Just like Taskwarrior, an empty configuration file means
              we are using all the default settings. If you want to use an
              alternate location, you can either symlink it to
              <code>~/.timewarrior</code>, or use the <code>TIMEWARRIORDB</code>
              environment variable to specify any location.
            </p>

            <a name="stopwatch"></a>
            <h4>Stopwatch</h4>
            <p>
              The most basic tracking can be done by using the stopwatch
              features. Just like a stopwatch, you start and stop a clock, and
              you can see the elapsed time. Start the clock when you begin
              work, and stop it when you are done. First let's see if the clock
              is running:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial3.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              No it's not. You can always run timewarrior with no arguments to
              see if the clock is running, and no data is modified. Let's start
              the clock.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial4.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              The clock is now running. In reality there is no clock and all
              that happened was that the start time was recorded, so don't be
              concerned about using system resources, as none are being used.
              Now when we check, we see a summary of the time recorded so far:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial5.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Once our work is complete, we stop the clock, and look at the
              summary.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial6.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              The summary report shows time that was tracked today by default.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a <code>continue</code> command that re-starts the
              previous tracking, and is useful if you stopped the clock during
              lunch, or overnight.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial7.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              See how every time the clock is started, there is a new line in
              the <code>summary</code> report?
            </p>

            <p>
              It is important to note that it is possible, and quite likely,
              that you will start the clock and leave it running by mistake.
              This is in fact one of the most annoying problems with any time
              tracking solution that relies on human interaction. While some
              tools will detect inactivity and stop the clock for you,
              Timewarrior does not. Instead it deals with this problem in two
              ways, first by making it easy to correct tracked time, and second
              by way of exclusions, which we will cover later.
            </p>

            <a name="tags"></a>
            <h4>Tags</h4>
            <p>
              The examples so far did not use tags. Tags are optional, but when
              you do make use of tags, you start tracking time spent on
              <em>different</em> activities.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial8.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              This example is tracking time using two different tags. The first
              is <kbd>Using Tags</kbd>, the second is <kbd>Software</kbd>.
              The first tag is two words, and because of the space between them,
              the quotes are needed to keep those two words together in one tag.
              The second tag is a single word and needs no quotes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial9.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              You can see that using tags is useful, but optional.
              Once you are using tags, you can use them to filter reports,
              such as the <code>summary</code> report.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial10.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a <code>tags</code> command, which will show you all the
              tags you have used.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial11.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              You may wonder how is that 'Description' column in the report used?
              It is the first example of tag metadata, which you can configure.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial12.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              This is not currently used, but does represent how Timewarrior
              will be extended to include tag metadata in future releases.
            </p>

            <a name="help"></a>
            <h4>Help</h4>
            <p>
              Although we have just begun, it is important to mention the
              built-in help system. Let's look at the help for the
              <code>continue</code> command.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial13.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              You can see that the help system contains examples, and introduces
              new commands and other help topics. From the help text, we learn
              that the <code>continue</code> command will not only resume tracking
              but use the same set of tags.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to the built-in help, there is a man page which
              contains the same information plus a lot more.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial14.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <a name="historical"></a>
            <h4>Historical</h4>
            <p>
              We have seen how to use the stopwatch feature, and combine it with
              tags. Additionally we can record time <i>ex post facto</i>. So to
              track time I spent earlier in the day (but forgot to record), I use
              the <code>track</code> command.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial15.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              When Timewarrior sees a time like <code>9:00</code> it always
              assumes it is in the past, because Timewarrior is a tool for
              recording what you have done or are doing, and is not a
              forward-looking planning tool.

              This is the opposite of Taskwarrior, which always looks forward,
              because tasks are generally going to be completed in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are other ways to specify time in the past, for example:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial16.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              And there are many more, which can be seen in the help system.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial17.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to time, you can specify date and time, so one
              equivalent command would use an ISO datetime.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial18.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Again, you can see all the date formats listed using the help
              system.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial19.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Using date synonyms you can track time for a whole month.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial20.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              But that command will track all 30 days, all 24 hours each in June,
              including weekends, holidays and lunch breaks. Or does it? This
              is discussed later.
            </p>

            <a name="hints"></a>
            <h4>Hints</h4>
            <p>
              Many commands support hints, which are words that start with a
              <code>:</code> and are convenient representations to save time.
              Here is the <code>:quiet</code> hint, being used to suppress all
              feedback:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial21.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>:quiet</code> hint is the same as disabling verbosity,
              but is easier to specify, and temporary. Another hint is
              <code>:yes</code>, which is used to override confirmation, by
              automatically answering 'yes' to the question.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some hints are shortcuts specifiers for date ranges. For example,
              the <code>:yesterday</code> hint is a date range representing all
              day yesterday. Similarly, <code>:lastweek</code> is also a date
              range. That makes the following two commands identical (assuming
              that today is the 6th):
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial22.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              The help system lists all the supported hints.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial23.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <a name="charts"></a>
            <h4>Charts</h4>
            <p>
              Timewarrior has a built-in chart that can show blocks of time by
              day. This is a text-based chart so it is not high resolution and
              has no drill-down capabilities. (Incidentally such a chart would
              be possible using the extension API, but by default, Timewarrior
              just has simple charting).
            </p>

            <p>
              There are three charts, which are really just three variations of
              the same chart, all controlled by configuration. We'll take a
              look at these charts, but first we need some sample data to look
              at.  Let us first track a couple of days of data, to illustrate
              how the charts work.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial24.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              We have tracked six separate intervals, and the summary report
              shows just that.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial25.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              The summary report gives accurate time values, so this should be
              the preferred report for this reason. Let's look at the first
              chart, the <code>day</code> report.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial26.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Like the <code>summary</code> report, the <code>day</code> report
              shows data for today by default. You can make it show multiple
              days like this:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial27.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              A better option is to use the <code>week</code> report.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial28.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              There is also a <code>month</code> report that looks the same,
              but is longer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Again, the only difference between these reports is configuration,
              and you can override any of this to customize these charts.
              See <code>man timew</code> for full configuration details.
            </p>

              We have seen the <code>summary</code> and <code>tags</code> reports,
              but there is another useful report that shows the untracked time
              in the day.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial29.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>gaps</code> report is useful for finding time in the day
              where you were not tracking time. In the example the gaps
              correspond well to time that was not spent working, so there is
              no need for adjustments.
            </p>

            <p>
              All reports in Timewarrior can be filtered by time interval and
              tags, but all have a default time interval.
            </p>

            <a name="themes"></a>
            <h4>Themes</h4>
            <p>
              Timewarrior has color themes that are mostly used by the charts
              to color the different parts of the display. To use a color theme,
              add this line to your <code>~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg</code>
              file with a text editor:
            </p>

            <pre>import /path/to/themes/dark_green.theme</pre>

            <p>
              Note that the path <code>/path/to/themes</code> is a placeholder.
              Your installation will likely use a path more like this, but it
              should be noted that this path varies depending on platform and
              the wishes of the packager.
            </p>

            <pre>import /usr/local/share/doc/timew/doc/themes/dark_green.theme</pre>

            <p>
              There are a few simple themes available initially, but this
              collection will grow and improve. Timewarrior is also likely to
              make greater use of themes in future releases.
            </p>

            <a name="holidays"></a>
            <h4>Holidays</h4>
            <p>
              Timewarrior can also make use of Holiday files. In the same way
              that a color theme was imported into the configuration file, a
              holiday file can also be used:
            </p>

            <pre>import /usr/local/share/doc/timew/doc/holidays/holidays.en-US</pre>

            <p>
              Again, that path is platform-dependent, so use the appropriate path
              for your system.
            </p>

            <p>
              When a holiday file is used, Timewarrior knows that there are some
              days in the year that are not work days. While this changes nothing
              about your ability to track time, it does affect some automatic
              tracking features, which we will cover next.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a <code>README</code> document and a <code>refresh</code>
              script provided with the holiday file, which explains how to update
              the holiday data, and how to obtain holiday files for other locales.
              Note that only the <code>en-US</code> locale is included by default.
            </p>

            <a name="exclusions"></a>
            <h4>Exclusions</h4>
            <p>
              Exclusions are a very powerful Timewarrior feature, and make
              automatic time tracking possible. An exclusion - much like a
              holiday - represents a block of time where you do not expect to
              work.
            </p>

            <p>
              The simplest exclusion is a day off work. Suppose you took a day
              off, on August 4th. You can define this day as an exclusion.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial30.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              The date must be formatted in this precise way. Note the use of the
              <code>:yes</code> hint to override confirmation.
              Now we see on the <code>week</code> report that the day is marked
              as non-working.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial31.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Similarly, if you worked on a holiday, you can define that day as
              a work day, and therefore available for automatic tracking.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial32.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Here we have (re)defined January 1st as a working day, which was
              previously defined as a holiday in the <code>en-US</code> locale.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to whole days working or not working, you can define
              exclusions for each day of the week to represent your work
              schedule. Suppose you work a regular weekly schedule, that starts
              at 8:30am, Monday to Friday, with weekends off. You take a
              45-minute lunch break each day, and leave work at 5:30pm. On
              Fridays you leave early.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial33.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              You can view this in the <code>week</code> report, and here we
              will use the <code>:blank</code> hint to remove all the tracked
              data from the report, leaving only the exclusions.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial34.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Your whole work week is defined. While you are not at all
              constrained by this defined schedule, it does control automatic
              time tracking.
            </p>

            <a name="automatic"></a>
            <h4>Automatic Tracking</h4>
            <p>
              Once you have defined exclusions for your workweek, the tracked
              time will conform to the set boundaries. Suppose this is our work
              week:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial35.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              There is no tracked time, but there are 40:15:00 hours available
              to be tracked.  If we worked the whole week on our
              <kbd>Research</kbd> project, we can track all that time with one
              command:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial36.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              We see that the exclusions are automatically subtracted from the
              time, and fill the whole week, leaving no available time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that this example tracks up until 'now', and as this tutorial
              is being written on a weekend, you can see that the tracking stops
              on Friday, and does not continue into the weekend.

              If this was being done on the Friday, at 16:23, then the
              <code>week</code> report would stop precisely at 16:23, because it
              is an open interval.
            </p>

            <a name="corrections"></a>
            <h4>Corrections</h4>
            <p>
              With or without the use of <a href="#exclusions">exclusions</a>,
              there is always the need to make corrections to the tracked time.
              As mentioned earlier, it is quite likely that the clock would be
              left running by mistake, or that the tracking was started or
              stopped at the wrong time. We will create some incorrect time
              tracking, and then correct it.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial37.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              I actually started work at 8:30am, but forgot to start the clock
              at the beginning. I also did not take a break at 10am, I again
              forgot to start the clock. Then I was working on projectC since
              about 11am, but didn't record it properly.
            </p>

            <p>
              These are typical mistakes, and are easy to fix, as there are
              several commands for making adjustments like this.
            </p>

            <p>
              To make an adjustment to an interval, we need first to identify
              that interval. The <code>summary</code>, <code>day</code>,
              <code>week</code> and <code>month</code> reports all support the
              <code>:ids</code> hint for this purpose. If we take a look at the
              <code>summary</code> report with the hint:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial38.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice how the intervals now have IDs: <code>@3</code> for the
              oldest interval. Let's make some corrections:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial39.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              There is still a problem, interval <code>@2</code> needs to occupy
              the slot between 10am and 11am. There is a <code>:fill</code> hint
              that does this for us.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial40.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>@1</code> ID always represents the newest interval.
              Note that if my corrections have changes the order, then the IDs
              would be different, and you would need to run
              <code>timew summary :ids</code> again to see the new IDs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, I actually stopped for lunch at 12:30 for 45 minutes:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial41.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Let's keep going, even though this example has already exceeded
              credibility, to demonstrate more. I need to change that
              <kbd>projectB</kbd> interval to use <kbd>projectB1</kbd> and
              <kbd>projectB2</kbd> tags, and divide the time between the two.
              We will split the interval, the re-tag it.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial42.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice how the <code>split</code> command just divided
              <code>@3</code> into two even-sized intervals. But we're still
              not done - I brought lunch to work and ate at my desk while
              working so let's eliminate that lunch break.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial43.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Now whether this report now accurately represents your day, or
              whether it is a fiction you need to report (no judgement here),
              Timewarrior supports it, but let's stop - the example can't take
              much more.
            </p>

            <p>
              We saw the <code>stop</code> command with a specific end time,
              the <code>move</code>, the <code>lengthen</code>, <code>split</code>,
              <code>join</code>, <code>tag</code> and <code>untag</code> commands
              and the <code>:fill</code> hint being used. There are also the
              <code>shorten</code>, <code>cancel</code>, and <code>delete</code>
              commands.  See <code>man timew</code> for full details.
            </p>

            <a name="extensions"></a>
            <h4>Extensions</h4>
            <p>
              Timewarrior reports are not sophisticated, they are minimally
              functional and focus on simply displaying the data. What if you
              need a report broken down by tags, with weekly subtotals?
            </p>

            <p>
              Timewarrior supports extension reports, via the
              <a href="/docs/timewarrior/api.html">extension API</a>.
              This is mechanism that allows you to write a report using any
              language you choose. Don't like the way the summary report shows
              the data? Write your own. Better yet, share the result, and we'll
              build a list of 3rd party reports.
            </p>

            <p>
              We've included one extension report with Timewarrior, and will add
              more. The one provided is:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial44.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Again, that path is platform-dependent, so use the appropriate path
              for your system.

              Note that this is a Python script, and to use this you'll need to
              have Python installed.
            </p>

            <p>
              To install and use this extension, or any other, simply copy it
              to your <code>~/.timewarrior/extensions</code> directory and make
              sure it is executable.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial45.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-danger">
              <h4>Caution</h4>
              <p>
                <b>Extensions are dangerous things</b>.
                As with any downloaded program, be careful - you are giving
                execute permission to software that may harm you.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fortunately this is the world of open source, and while that does
                not mean the software is safe, it does mean you have the
                necessary access to audit the code and prove it is safe.

                If you find the code safe, use it.
                If you are unsure, don't.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              Once the extension is in the <code>extensions</code> directory, and
              executable, it should be visible to the <code>extensions</code>
              command.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial46.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, the <code>diagnostics</code> command will report the
              presence and status of this extension.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once an extension is ready to use, it is used in the same way that
              the <code>summary</code> report is used, with date range and/or
              tag filtering. The command you use is compared to the name of the
              script, and if unique, is a match. All of these commands are
              equivalent:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial47.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Here is the report run with no filter, and therefore against all
              recorded data, which is not much in this example.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial48.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Extensions are not restricted to emitting text, they could for
              example output HTML, DOT, PDF, PNG, JPEG ...
            </p>

            <a name="integration"></a>
            <h4>Integration</h4>
            <p>
              Timewarrior integrates with Taskwarrior by means of a Taskwarrior
              <code>on-modify</code> hook script. Once installed, this means that
              whenever a task is active, Timewarrior is used to track the time.
            </p>

            <p>
              To install the script, copy it into your Taskwarrior directory:
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="/docs/timewarrior/images/tutorial49.png" class="img-responsive" />
            </p>

            <p>
              Again, that path is platform-dependent, so use the appropriate path
              for your system.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now we can create a task, start it, complete it and automatically
              track it.

            <p>
              The <code>on-modify.timewarrior</code> hook script captures the
              task description and all tags and passes these to Timewarrior as
              tags. If a project was assigned (it was not in this example) then
              it too would have been passed as a tag.
            </p>

            <p>
              Is this behavior modifiable?  Yes, this is open source, and the
              hook script is written in Python.
            </p>

            <h4>End</h4>

              You've made it to the end of the tutorial. You now know more
              about Timewarrior than most users. If you have feedback, we are
              interested in hearing it, because open source is a collaborative
              effort, and you are part of that.
