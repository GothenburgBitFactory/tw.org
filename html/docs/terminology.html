          Taskwarrior and Taskserver use a lot of terminology that is not
          obvious.  Those terms are defined here.

              When a task is started, like this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 1 start</pre>

            <p>
              It gains a <code>start</code> attribute, which is a date.
              When started, a task is considered <em>active</em>, until
              completed, deleted or stopped.
            </p>

          <dd>
            <p>
              An alias is name that can be used on the command line, which is
              replaced by its definition at run time. For example, you can use
              an alias to create a synonym for a command, like this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task config alias.rm delete</pre>

            <p>
              Then whenever the <code>rm</code> alias is encountered, it is
              replaced by <code>delete</code>, making these two commands
              equivalent:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 1 delete
$ task 2 rm</pre>

            <p>
              An alias can appear elsewhere on the command line, and is not
              limited to command synonyms.

            <p>
              An <code>annotation</code> is a note added to an existing task, and
              is in the form of a text string. There can be any number of
              annotations to a task.
            </p>

            <pre>$ task add Buy the milk
$ task 1 annotate and Bread
$ task 1 annotate and Cheese</pre>

            <p>
              Some reports show the annotations in full, some show an annotation
              count, and some simply show an indicator that there are annotations.

            <p>
              A task is comprised of a set of attrbitutes, which are simply
              name/value pairs.  As an example, <code>project</code> is an
              attribute, the name being <code>project</code>, and the value being
              what you assign to that project.
            </p>

            <pre>$ task add project:Home Rake the leaves</pre>

            <p>
              Here you see the <code>project</code> attribute being directly set
              to <code>Home</code>, and the <code>description</code> attribute
              indirectly set to <code>Rake the leaves</code>.

              Taskwarrior includes a small utility program named <code>calc</code>
              that uses the Taskwarrior expression engine to calculate values.
              This utility mirrors the <code>calc</code> command.  Here is an
              example:
            </p>

            <pre>$ calc '1 + 2 * 3'
7</pre>

            <p>
              The <code>calc</code> utility is mostly for testing, and allows
              access to internal features, such as postfix expressions:
            </p>

            <pre>$ calc --postfix '1 2 3 * +'
7</pre>

            <p>
              While this is just a simple example, there is also support
              for dates, durations, Boolean operations and many operators.
            </p>

            <p>
              See <a href="/docs/commands/calc.html">Calc Command</a> for full details.

              A Taskwarrior command can be a read-only command, wherein data is
              not modified:
            </p>

            <pre>list, info, calendar ...</pre>

            <p>
              Or it can be a write command, where data is modified:
            </p>

            <pre>add, modify, done, delete ...</pre>

            <p>
              The distinction is important because it dictates how the command
              line arguments are interpreted.

              run as daemons, and are automatically launched on startup.
              Typically daemons are named ending with 'd'.
            </p>

            <p>
              Taskserver (taskd) can be run as a daemon, using the

              Taskwarrior supports the notion of a default command, which is
              used when no other command is specified on the command line.
              Suppose you have this setting:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task config default.command list
$ task +tag</pre>

            <p>
              Then the default command above of <code>list</code> would be used
              in the subsequent command, to effectively become:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task +tag list</pre>

            <p>
              <span class="label label-success">2.4.0</span>
              When no command is specified, and the only arguments are task
              <code>ID</code> or <code>UUID</code> values, the <code>info</code>
              command is assumed, regardless of the <code>rc.default.command</code>
              setting.
            </p>

            <p>
              <code>Deleted</code> is one of several states a task can be in.
              The others are <code>pending</code>, <code>waiting</code>,
              <code>completed</code> and <code>recurring</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>deleted</code> state indicates an incomplete task that
              is removed from the list, perhaps because it is no longer
              relevant, or someone else completed it.

              A due date may be applied to a task, like this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 1 modify due:25th</pre>

            <p>
              A task with a due date has a higher urgency value, and generally
              sorts higher in reports. The due date is considered the date on
              which the task must be completed.
            </p>

            <p>
              A task is consided due, if the due date is within 7 days in the
              future. The '7' is configurable via the <code>due</code>
              configuration setting.  If a due date is further into the future
              it is not considered due.  If the due date is in the past, it is
              considered overdue, and these tasks are shown in the
              <code>overdue</code> report.

              When a task is first created, it is automatically assigned an
              <code>entry</code> date. This attribute is used to calculate the
              age of a task. This date is modifiable, should you wish to enter
              an old task.

            <p>
              <em>En-passant</em> is used to describe the action of annotating
              or otherwise modifying a task while making some other change to
              it. An example is deleting a task, and adding an explanatory note
              at the ѕame time. Instead of doing this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 123 annotate Could not reproduce bug
$ task 123 modify +cannot_reproduce
$ task 123 delete</pre>

            <p>
              Those three actions can be combined:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 123 delete Could not reproduce bug +cannot_reproduce</pre>

            <p>
              For every write command, except <code>modify</code>, you can
              perform <em>en-passant</em> modifications. The <code>modify</code>
              is different, and updates the task description instead of annotating.

              Task can be exported from Taskwarrior, using the <code>export</code>

            <p>
              Tasks are exported using the

              An algebraic expression is a mathematical expression comprised of
              constants, operators and symbols.  Here are some examples of

              An extension is a program that adds functionality to Taskwarrior.
              This could be in the form of a wrapper
              (<a href="https://gothenburgbitfactory.org/projects/vit.html">Vit</a>),
              or an aliased script, or a

              A filter is a set of command line arguments used to restrict the
              number of tasks shown. For example, this command uses three filter
              terms:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task project:Home +kitchen +weekend list</pre>

            <p>
              This command will show a report that contains tasks that have the
              project value 'Home', and have the <code>kitchen</code> and
              <code>weekend</code> tags. The three terms are combined with an
              implicit <code>AND</code> operator.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, the command above combines the three terms in the filter
              with the implicit filter of the <code>list</code> command, which
              is:
            </p>

            <pre>status:pending</pre>

            <p>
              So in total, the command has four filter terms, that restrict the
              tasks shown. A filter is essentially an ælgebraic expression that
              must evalute to <code>True</code> for each task, for it to be
              included in the result.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most commands accept filters. See

              Taskwarrior performs a Garbage Collect (gc) operation whenever it
              is necessary. Tasks that are deleted and completed are moved from
              the <code>pending.data</code> file to the <code>completed.data</code>
              file. This process keeps the <code>pending.data</code> file compact
              and fast to read, and keeps the ID numbers as low as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although gc can be disabled, to keep the ID numbers static,

              JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an industry-standard,

              and machines to read and write. It is well supported by most
              languages.
            </p>

            <p>
              JSON is the only import/export format supported by Taskwarrior.
              Support for any other format requires conversion between JSON and
              the other format. There are several examples of this provided
              with Taskwarrior, in the <code>scripts/add-ons</code> directory.

              A list break is associated with report sorting, such that when
              a report is sorted on an attribute, a list break for that attribute
              causes a blank line to be inserted between unique values of that
              attribute. For example, the sort definition:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task show report.list.sort

Config Variable  Value
---------------- ------------------------------------
report.list.sort start-,due+,project+/,urgency-</pre>

            <p>
              Here the <code>project</code> attribute is sorted ascending and

              An override refers to the action of superceding a configuration
              setting at runtime. For example, support for <code>rc.color</code>
              is 'on' by default, but at runtime, you can override this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task rc.color=off list</pre>

            <p>
              This runs the <code>list</code> report but does not use color.
            </p>

            <p>
              Any number of settings can be overridden at runtime, and overrides
              can also appear in the <code>rc.report.&lt;report&gt;.filter</code>
              setting for a report, so that you can have a report run without
              color, for example.

              A regex, or <strong>Reg</strong>ular <strong>Ex</strong>pression is
              a very powerful mechanism for searching and matching text. It is a

              Suppose you were solving a crossword puzzle, and needed a five

              <strong>R</strong>everse <strong>P</strong>olish
              <strong>N</strong>otation, or postfix notation is a mathematical
              notation. This example:
            </p>

            <pre>1 2 +</pre>

            <p>
              Represents the sum of two digits, with the <code>+</code> operator
              in the postfix position, last.
            </p>

            <p>
              Writing software to evaluate postfix expressions is significantly

            <p>
              The <code>scheduled</code> date represents the first opportunity
              to begin work on a task, and therefore typically is set to be on
              or after the <a href="#wait">wait</a> date, but before the
              <a href="#due">due</a> date.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you add a scheduled date to a task, like this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 1 modify scheduled:2014-12-31</pre>

            <p>
              Then this task will be considered <em>ready</em> after that date.
              The <a href="#vtag">virtual tag</a> <code>READY</code> reflects
              this, and the report <code>ready</code> shows such tasks.

            <p>
              Any program that has complex argument processing will likely face
              several problems that are shell-related. The shell modifies the
              entered text before passing it on to the program. For example,
              consider these two commands:
            </p>

            <pre>$ ls my_file
$ ls 'my_file'</pre>

            <p>
              In both cases, the <code>ls</code> command sees the same command
              line argument, <code>my_file</code>, because the shell removes the
              quotes. There are many other cases to be aware of also.

              If you apply a <code>start</code> date to a task, then the task
              is considered <em>active</em>. Active tasks have a higher urgency
              value, and can be listed using the <code>active</code> command.
              There are two ways to apply a start date, the latter giving you
              control over the recorded start date:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 1 start
$ task 1 modify start:now</pre>

            <p>
              If the configuration setting <code>journal.info</code> is on,
              then when a task is started or stopped, an
              <a href="#annotation">annotation</a>
              is made to that effect.  The cumulative start/stop times can be
              viewed in the <a href="#info">info</a> report.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that this does not imply there is time tracking in
              Taskwarrior, this is simply a log of start/stop times, and is not
              modifiable. Many users confuse this log with legitimate time
              tracking capabilities. Don't make this mistake.

              A task may have any number of tags attached to it. A tag is
              a single word (no spaces), and can be included when the task
              is created:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task add Paint the walls +home +weekend</pre>

            <p>
              This adds two tags <code>home</code> and <code>weekend</code>
              to the task.  You can modify a task to add a <code>renovate</code>
              tag:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 1 modify +renovate</pre>

            <p>
              Or remove a <code>weekend</code> tag:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 1 modify -weekend</pre>

              A taskwarrior theme is a file containing color definitions. There
              are several themes provided with Taskwarrior, and these are listed
              in your <code>.taskrc</code> file, and if you uncomment one of
              these lines, then the them is included, and you see a set of
              chosen and thematic colors.  Your <code>.taskrc</code> file should
              contain this section:
            </p>

            <pre># Color theme (uncomment one to use)
#include /usr/local/share/doc/task/rc/light-16.theme

            <p>
              All of these lines are said to be 'commented out', which means the
              '#' symbol at the beginning of the line prevents Taskwarrior from
              reading the rest of the line. Removing a '#' enables the color
              theme. For example, to enable the <code>dark-violets-256.theme</code>
              file, change the above to look like this:
            </p>

            <p>
              Taskwarrior supports a set of about 20 or so core attributes,
              which include ID, descriptions, tags, due date and so on. These
              attributes are necessary for the basic features provided.
            </p>

            <p>
              But suppose you wanted to track a time estimate. There is no
              attribute for that, although you could store data in an attribute.
              A better solution is a User Defined Attribute, named
              <code>estimate</code>, of type <code>numeric</code>, that you
              define via configuration like this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task config uda.estimate.label Estimate
$ task config uda.estimate.type duration</pre>

            <p>
              Once you have defined a UDA, you use it just like you would use
              any other core attribute, like this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task add Paint the door due:eom estimate:4hours</pre>

            <p>
              Taskwarrior will faithfully store, report, sort and filter UDA
              attributes, but of course their true meaning is not understood,
              and so there are no features surrounding these values.
            </p>

            <p>
              UDAs may contribute to the urgency calculation, using:
            </p>

            <pre>urgency.uda.&lt;name&gt;.coefficient</pre>

            <p>
              UDAs may have default values (<code>uda.&lt;name&gt;.default</code>),
              allowable values (<code>uda.&lt;name&gt;.values</code>), types
              (<code>string</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>duration</code>, and
              <code>numeric</code>) and finally a label for report headers
              (<code>uda.&lt;name&gt;.label</code>).
            </p>

            <p>
              See
              <a href="/docs/udas.html">User Defined Attributes (UDAs)</a>

          <dd>
            <p>
              The <code>until</code> date represents the date that a task is
              automatically deleted. It is an expiration date. If you add an
              until date like this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 1 modify until:eoy</pre>

            <p>
              Then this task will expire and disappear at the end of the year.
            </p>

            <p>
              The urgency of a task is a numeric quantity that represents task
              attributes that convey importance. Consider these two tasks:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task add Buy the paint   due:saturday +home +renovate +store
$ task add Paint the walls due:sunday   +home +renovate</pre>

            <p>
              The first task is due sooner, and there is no question that it is
              more important than the second, after all, the second is blocked
              by the first. Dependencies could be used here to represent this,
              but this is just an example.
            </p>

            <p>
              We would like the first task to sort higher than the second task,
              in this case because of the due date. But not every task has
              (or needs) a due date. Urgency is therefore a way to raise and
              lower tasks in the sorted list.
              This cannot be achieved by simply providing a complex sort order,
              because usage patterns are different for everyone.
            </p>

            <p>
              Urgency is implemented as a polynomial, where the term weights are
              configurable to make an attribute an important contributor to
              urgency (high positive number), a marginal contributor (low
              positive number), a detractor (negative number) or have no
              influence at all (zero).
            </p>

            <p>
              While the urgency value in isolation is meaningless, when compared
              to that of other tasks, helps order the tasks by importance.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>urgency</code> attribute is featured in the
              <code>next</code> report, although can be used in any report.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the polynomial term weights (coefficients) are all modifiable,
              you can tweak them to make the urgency value more closely match
              your own notions of importance. Provided you understand the way
              the coefficients are used, this can be very beneficial.

              A <strong>U</strong>niversally <strong>U</strong>nique
              <strong>ID</strong>entifier is a 128-bit number used to
              uniquely identify a task.  Whereas the ID of a task is
              simply a line number in the <code>pending.data</code> file, the
              UUID is permanent.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can use ID and UUID interchangeably, although the
              ID is much more convenient.

              Verbosity refers to the output Taskwarrior generates. For example
              if you run a report, the output might looks like this (data

            <p>
              Aside from the actual data, there is an initial blank line, a set
              of column headers, another blank line, the summary '31 tasks', the
              configuration override, and the filter used. All of these
              decorative elements, and more, are controlled by the verbosity
              settings in the <code>verbose</code> configuration setting.

              The tag notation for filters is convenient and simple, for
              example:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task +HOME list
...
$ task -HOME list</pre>

            <p>
              The first lists only tasks that have the <code>HOME</code> tag,
              and the second lists only tasks that do not have the
              <code>HOME</code> tag.
            </p>

            <p>
              A virtual tag is a means of performing simple filtering, using
              tags that are synthesized at run time, and represent the complex
              internal state of a task.  For example the virtual tag
              <code>ACTIVE</code> is an easy way to filter tasks that have
              been started, so that this command:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task +ACTIVE list</pre>

            <p>
              Is a more friendly and simple way to represent this equivalent
              command:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task start.any: list</pre>

            <p>
              See <a href="#tag">Tag</a>, <a href="#stag">Special Tags</a>.

          <dd>
            <p>
              If you add a <code>wait</code> date to a task like this:
            </p>

            <pre>$ task 1 modify wait:30th</pre>

            <p>
              Then the task is hidden from reports until the 30th of the month,
              whereupon the wait date is removed, and the task becomes visible.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is useful for tasks that are far into the future, where you
              may not appreciate seeing that task on every list, at least until
              it gets closer to the due date.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that a due date is not required to use this feature.

              The <code>waiting</code> command is a report that shows tasks that
              are currently hidden because they have a future <code>wait</code>
              date.
            </p>

            <p>
              <code>Waiting</code> is also one of several states a task can be in.
              The others are <code>pending</code>, <code>completed</code>,
              <code>deleted</code> and <code>recurring</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>waiting</code> state indicates a pending task that is
              hidden from view.
