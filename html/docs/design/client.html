            <h3>Creating a Taskserver Client</h3>
            <p>
              A Taskserver client is a todo-list manager.  It may be as simple as a
              program that captures a single task, as complex as Taskwarrior, or anything
              in between.  It can be a mobile client, a web application, or any other type
              of program.
            </p>

            <p>
              This document describes how such a client would interact with the server.
            </p>

            <p>
              A client to the Taskserver is a program that manages a task list, and wishes
              to exchange data with the server so that the task list may be shared.
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to do this, a client must store tasks locally, upload local changes,
              download remote changes, and apply remote changes to the local tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
              The client must consider that there may be no network connectivity, or no
              desire by the user to synchronize.
            </p>

            <p>
              The client will need proper credentials to talk to the server.
            </p>

            <a name="req"></a>
            <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <p>
              In this document, we adopt the convention discussed in Section 1.3.2 of
              <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-16">RFC1122</a>
              of using the capitalized words MUST, REQUIRED, SHOULD, RECOMMENDED,
              MAY, and OPTIONAL to define the significance of each particular requirement
              specified in this document.
            </p>

            <p>
              In brief: "MUST" (or "REQUIRED") means that the item is an absolute
              requirement of the specification; "SHOULD" (or "RECOMMENDED") means there may
              exist valid reasons for ignoring this item, but the full implications should
              be understood before doing so; and "MAY" (or "OPTIONAL") means that this item
              is optional, and may be omitted without careful consideration.
            </p>

            <a name="account"></a>
            <h4>Taskserver Account</h4>
            <p>
              A Taskserver account must be created.  This process creates a storage area,
              and generates the necessary credentials.
            </p>

            <a name="credentials"></a>
            <h4>Credentials</h4>
            <p>
              A Taskserver client needs the following credentials in order to communicate
              with a server:
            </p>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Server address and port</li>
                <li>Organization name</li>
                <li>User name</li>
                <li>Password</li>
                <li>Certificate</li>
                <li>Key</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The server address and port are the network location of the server.  An
              example of this value is:
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>ack.tasktools.org:53589</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to a DNS name, this can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
            </p>

            <p>
              The organization name is an arbitrary grouping, and is typically 'PUBLIC',
              reflecting the individual nature of server accounts.  Future capabilities
              will provide functionality that support groups of users, called an
              organization.
            </p>

            <p>
              The user name is the full name.  This will be the name used to identify other
              users in an organization, in a future release.  Example 'John Doe'.
            </p>

            <p>
              The password is a text string generated by the server at account creation
              time.  It should be considered a secret.
            </p>

            <p>
              The certificate is an X.509 PEM file generated by the server at account
              creation time.  This is used for authentication.  It should be considered a
              secret.
            </p>

            <p>
              The key is an X.509 PEM file generated by the server at account creation
              time.  This is used for encryption.  It should be considered a secret.
            </p>

            <p>
              These credentials need to be stored on the client, and used during the sync
              operation.
            </p>

            <a name="client_desc"></a>
            <h4>Description of a Taskserver Client</h4>
            <p>
              This section describes how a client might behave in order to facilitate
              integration with the Taskserver.
            </p>

            <a name="encryption"></a>
            <h4>Encryption</h4>
            <p>
              The Taskserver only communicates using encryption.  Therefore all user data
              is encrypted while in transit.  The Taskserver currently uses
              <a href="http://gnutls.org">GnuTLS</a>
              to support this encryption, and therefore supports the following
              protocols:
            </p>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>SSL 3.0</li>
                <li>TLS 1.0</li>
                <li>TLS 1.1</li>
                <li>TLS 1.2</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The client may use any library that supports the above.
            </p>

            <a name="config"></a>
            <h4>Configuration</h4>
            <p>
              The client needs to store configuration, which matches the credentials needed
              for Taskserver communication.  See section 2.1 "Credentials".
            </p>

            <p>
              The credentials may not be modified by the user without losing server access.
            </p>

            <p>
              The server:port data may need to be changed automatically following a
              redirect response from the server.  See section 5 "Server Errors".
            </p>

            <a name="storage"></a>
            <h4>Local Storage</h4>
            <p>
              The client needs to store task data locally.  The client will need to be able
              to find tasks by their UUID and overwrite them.  Uploaded and downloaded task
              changes will use the
              <a href="/docs/design/task.html">Taskwarrior Data Interchange Format</a>.
            </p>

            <a name="changes"></a>
            <h4>Local Changes</h4>
            <p>
              Whenever local data is modified, that change MUST be synced with the server.
              But this does not have to occur immediately, in fact the client SHOULD NOT
              assume connectivity at any time.
            </p>

            <p>
              A client SHOULD NOT also assume that the server is available.  If the server
              is not available, the local changes should be retained, and the sync
              operation repeated later.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ideally the client will give the user full control over sync operations.
              Automatically syncing after all local modifications is not recommended.  If a
              client performs too many sync operations, the server MAY revoke the
              certificate.
            </p>

            <p>
              Effectively, the client should maintain a separate list of tasks changed
              since the last successful sync operation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that tasks have a "modified" attribute, which should be updated whenever
              a change is made.  This attribute contributes to conflict resolution on the
              server.
            </p>

            <a name="remote"></a>
            <h4>Remote Changes</h4>
            <p>
              When a server sends remote changes to a client, in the response to a sync
              request, the changes have already been merged by the server, and therefore
              the client should simply store them intact.
            </p>

            <p>
              Based on the UUID in the task, the client can determine whether a task is
              new (and should be added to the local list of tasks), or whether it
              represents a modification (and should overwrite it's existing entry).
            </p>

            <p>
              The client MUST NOT perform any merges.
            </p>

            <a name="sync_key"></a>
            <h4>Sync Key</h4>
            <p>
              Whenever a sync is performed, the server responds by sending a sync key and
              any remote changes.  The sync key is important, and should be included in the
              next sync request.  The client is REQUIRED to store the sync key in every
              server response message.
            </p>

            <p>
              If a client omits the sync key in a sync message, the response will be a
              complete set of all tasks and modifications.
            </p>

            <a name="integrity"></a>
            <h4>Data Integrity</h4>
            <p>
              Although a task is guaranteed to contain at least 'entry', 'description' and
              'uuid' attributes, it may also contain other known fields, and unknown
              user-defined fields.  An example might be an attribute named 'estimate'.
            </p>

            <p>
              If a task is received via sync that contains an attribute named 'estimate',
              then a client has the responsibility of preserving the attribute intact.  If
              that data is shown, then it is assumed to be of type 'string', which is the
              format used by JSON for all values.
            </p>

            <p>
              Conversely, if a client wishes to add a custom attribute, it is guaranteed
              that the server and other clients will preserve that attribute.
            </p>

            <p>
              Using this rule, two clients of differing capabilities can exchange data and
              still maintain custom attributes.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a requirement.  Any client that does not obey this requirement is
              broken.
            </p>

            <a name="synchronizing"></a>
            <h4>Synchronizing</h4>
            <p>
              Synchronizing with the Taskserver consists of a single transaction.  Once an
              encrypted connection is made with the server, the client MUST compose a
              <a href="/docs/design/request.html">sync request message</a>.
              This message includes credentials and
              local changes.  The response message contains status and remote changes,
              which MUST be stored locally.
            </p>

            <a name="connect"></a>
            <h4>Establishing Encrypted Connection</h4>
            <p>
              All communication with the Taskserver is encrypted using the certificate
              and key provided to each user.  Using the 'server' configuration setting,
              establish a connection.
            </p>

            <a name="sync_request"></a>
            <h4>Sync Request</h4>
            <p>
              See
              <a href="/docs/design/request.html">sync request message</a>.
              A sync request MUST contain a sync key if one was provided by a previous
              sync.  A sync request MUST contain a list of modified tasks, in JSON format (see
              <a href="/docs/design/task.html">Task JSON</a>),
              if local modifications have been made.
            </p>

            <a name="sync_response"></a>
            <h4>Sync Response</h4>
            <p>
              A sync response WILL contain a 'code' and 'status' header variable, WILL
              contain a sync key in the payload, and MAY contain a list of tasks from the
              server in JSON format (see
              <a href="/docs/design/task.html">Task JSON</a>).
            </p>

            <a name="server_messages"></a>
            <h4>Server Messages</h4>
            <p>
              There are cases when the server needs to inform the user of some condition.
              This may be anticipated server downtime, for example.  The response message
              is typically not present, but may be present in the header, containing a
              string:
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>...
message: Scheduled maintenance 2013-07-14 08:00UTC for 10 minutes.
...</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
              If such a message is returned by the server, it SHOULD be made available to
              the user.  This is a recommendation, not a requirement.
            </p>

            <a name="errors"></a>
            <h4>Server Errors</h4>
            <p>
              The server may generate many errors (See
              <a href="/docs/design/protocol.html">Protocol</a>),
              but the following is a list of the ones most in need of special handling:
            </p>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>200 Success</li>
                <li>201 No change</li>
                <li>301 Redirect</li>
                <li>430 Access denied</li>
                <li>431 Account suspended</li>
                <li>432 Account terminated</li>
                <li>5xx Error</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The 200 indicates success, and that a change was recorded.  The 201 indicates
              success but no changes were necessary.  The 301 is a redirect message
              indicating that the client MUST re-request from a new server.  The 43x series
              messages are account-related.  Any 5xx series code is a server error of some
              kind.  All errors consist of a code and a status message:
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>code: 200
status: Success</pre>
            </p>

            <a name="examples"></a>
            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <p>
              Here are examples of properly formatted request and response messages.  Note
              that the messages are indented for clarity in this document, but is not the
              case in a properly formatted message.  Also note that newline characters
              U+000D are not shown, but are implied by the separate lines.  Because some
              messages have trailing newline characters, the text is delimited by the 'cut'
              markers:
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>foo

</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
              The example above illustrates text consisting of:
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>U+0066   f
U+006F   o
U+006F   o
U+000D   newline
U+000D   newline</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that these values are left unspecified, but should be clear from the
              context, and the
              <a href="/docs/design/request.html">message format</a>
              spec:
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>&lt;size&gt;
&lt;organization&gt;

            </p>

            <a name="first"></a>
            <h4>First Sync</h4>
            <p>
              The first time a client syncs, there is (perhaps) no data to upload, and no
              sync key from a previous sync.
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>&lt;size&gt;type: sync
org: &lt;organization&gt;
user: &lt;user&gt;

protocol: v1

</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
              Note the double newline character separating header from payload, with an
              empty payload.
            </p>

            <a name="sync_no_data"></a>
            <h4>Request: Sync No Data</h4>
            <p>
              Ordinarily when a client syncs, there is a sync key from the previous sync
              response to send.  This example shows a sync with no local changes, but a
              sync key from a previous sync.
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>&lt;size&gt;type: sync

            <h4>Request: Sync Data</h4>
            <p>
              This sync request shows a sync key from the previous sync, and a locally
              modified task.
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>&lt;size&gt;type: sync

            <h4>Response: No Data</h4>
            <p>
              If a sync results in no downloads to the client, the response will look like
              this.

              Note that there is a sync key which must be stored and used in the next sync

            <a name="resp_data"></a>
            <h4>Response: Remote Data</h4>
            <p>
              This shows a sync response providing a new sync key, and a remote change to
              two tasks.

            <p>
              Note that the two changed tasks must be stored locally, and if the UUID in

            <h4>Reference Implementation</h4>
            <p>
              The Taskserver 1.1.0 codebase contains a reference implementation of an SSL/TLS
              client and server program, which communicate text strings.

              The Taskwarrior codebase, version 2.4.0, is the reference implementation.
