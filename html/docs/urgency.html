            <h3>Urgency</h3>
            <p>
              Taskwarrior has a <code>next</code> report, which is sorted by
              decreasing urgency. If that measure of urgency represents or
              approximates your idea of what is important, then the tasks you
              should start next will appear near the top of that list. But what
              is <em>urgency</em>?
            </p>

            <p>
              Sometimes a task list is driven by dependency, due date or
              perhaps priority. In these situations it is relatively easy to
              select a task to work on next. There are times however, when
              this is less clear and you would like to see tasks listed in some
              kind of common-sense order that embodies several factors.
            </p>

            <p>
              Urgency is a numeric score Taskwarrior assigns to each task. It
              is based on a dozen or more factors that combine to form an
              overall urgency score. Now this is not going to be a complete and
              accurate representation of urgency for many reasons, primarily
              because each of us has different criteria when judging the
              importance of a task. But it will <em>approximate</em> urgency,
              and that is the goal.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are many other real-life examples of algorithms that are
              used to approximate qualities: the Apgar Score that assesses the
              health of newborns, Google's Page Rank that measures the
              importance of a web link, or credit ratings. These examples all
              approximate, but cannot perfectly represent, a complex concept.
            </p>

            <p>
              Taskwarrior uses a polynomial expression to calculate urgency.
              This is a simple sum of terms, where each term represents some
              measurable quality of a task. For example, the priority of a
              task is an indicator of its urgency. A high priority is more
              urgent than a medium priority and so on. Even a low priority is
              more urgent than no priority. Priority settings should therefore
              contribute to the urgency score.
            </p>

            <p>
              Similarly, if a task is <code>waiting</code>, the urgency score
              should be reduced. If a task has a due date, then the closeness
              of that deadline should affect urgency. If a task is overdue, it
              should have a greater impact on urgency.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this way, the different terms can each contribute to the
              overall score, but there is a further need to identify which
              terms are important to you. This is achieved with configurable
              coefficients for each term. The urgency coefficients and their
              default values are:
            </p>

            <pre>urgency.user.tag.next.coefficient           15.0 # +next tag
urgency.due.coefficient                     12.0 # overdue or near due date
urgency.blocking.coefficient                 8.0 # blocking other tasks
urgency.uda.priority.H.coefficient           6.0 # high Priority
urgency.uda.priority.M.coefficient           3.9 # medium Priority
urgency.uda.priority.L.coefficient           1.8 # low Priority
urgency.scheduled.coefficient                5.0 # scheduled tasks
urgency.active.coefficient                   4.0 # already started tasks
urgency.age.coefficient                      2.0 # coefficient for age
urgency.annotations.coefficient              1.0 # has annotations
urgency.tags.coefficient                     1.0 # has tags
urgency.project.coefficient                  1.0 # assigned to any project
urgency.user.project.My Project.coefficient  5.0 # assigned to project:"My Project"
urgency.waiting.coefficient                 -3.0 # waiting task
urgency.blocked.coefficient                 -5.0 # blocked by other tasks</pre>

            <p>
              The first coefficient has a value of 15.0, which is the highest
              value. This means that any task with the <code>+next</code> tag
              has an urgency score of at least 15.0. The <code>+next</code>
              tag is known as a 'special tag', which is simply a tag that
              triggers some behavior in taskwarrior - in this case it elevates
              the urgency score. Because the coefficient has the largest
              value, it indicates that the <code>+next</code> tag has the
              greatest influence on urgency.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next most significant term is for tasks with a due date,
              then blocking tasks and so on. Note that blocked tasks have a
              coefficient of -5.0, which means that they reduce the urgency
              score.
            </p>

            <p>
              The lowest coefficient, that of annotations, has a value of 1.0.
              This means that a task with more annotations is more urgent than
              a task with fewer. The value of 1.0 means this is a weak
              contributor to urgency, but nevertheless means that tasks with
              lots of annotations are an indicator of some kind of focus of
              activity. You may not agree with this assessment however, and so
              you might set this coefficient to 0, which means you want the
              term to have no effect on urgency.
            </p>

            <p>
              The urgency caused by tags and annotations is further modified
              by the number of tags/annotations present: The factor is 0.8 for
              one, 0.9 for two and 1.0 for more.
            </p>

            <a name="custom"></a>
            <h4>Customizing Coefficients</h4>
            <p>
              The default coefficients have been chosen to represent all of the
              terms in a simple, common-sense way. While these do not
              necessarily reflect your own judgement, they should be considered
              a decent starting point.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before you make adjustments to these values, it is recommended
              that you use the next report as-is for a while. This will let
              you evaluate how effective the values are for your particular
              style. For example you might realize that tasks that are already
              started contribute unfairly to the urgency score. But it is
              useful to arrive at this conclusion based on usage, rather than
              simply reading the coefficient values above. But once you are
              familiar with the urgency scores and have developed a sense that
              things need to be tweaked, go ahead and change the values.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose you consider priority to be the most important factor.
              You might want to simply increase the value from 6.0 to 10.0.
              You might also want to reduce several other coefficients. Of
              course you are free to do anything you choose, but it is important
              to bear in mind that any one term in the polynomial should not
              dominate the expression. For example, setting a value of 30.0
              while all the other values are under 10.0 would be a mistake,
              because then there is really only one factor influencing urgency,
              and it will likely not reflect any subtleties.
            </p>

            <p>
              A more extreme example would be to set the coefficient for
              priority to 1.0, and all the other values to 0. This would
              result in a next report that is identical to one sorted only on
              priority.
            </p>

            <p>
              Adjustments to the coefficients should also be small. A good
              approach is to make all adjustments either the addition or
              subtraction of 1.0 to a value, thus limiting the effects of a
              change. The urgency algorithm is a subtle interplay of several
              factors, and that is one of its main strengths.
