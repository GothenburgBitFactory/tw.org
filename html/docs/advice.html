            <h3>What Have We Learned From This Open Source Project?</h3>
            <p>
              Here is the collected wisdom that we have gained from running the
              Taskwarrior project for more than a decade. It has been rewarding,
              enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating. We learned a lot about
              users and Open Source expectations.
            </p>

                    Start an open source project if you want to learn all you can about
                    software design, development, planning, testing, documenting, and
                    delivery; enjoy technical challenges, administrative challenges,
                    compromise, and will be satisfied hoping that someone out there is
                    benefitting from your work.

                    Do not start an open source project if you need praise, warmth and
                    love from your fellow human beings.

                    the activity, discussion and drama occurs at that boundary.

                    Feature requests only nibble at the periphery.
                    Bold changes originate elsewhere.
