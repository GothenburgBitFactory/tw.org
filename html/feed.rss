        This is an ongoing series of activity reports, published monthly,
        to highlight activity in our projects. Here is what happened between
        May and December 2017.

        This is not a complete list of all activity, just work that results
        in a non-trivial change. For a full list, see the git history of all
        the projects.

        This covers a seven month period. Due to unforeseen circumstances,
        there was a lengthy break in 2017. We're back.

        stable and ready.

        Timewarrior tracks your time from the command line and generates

        April was a relatively quiet month, but with two main efforts:
        Timewarrior 1.1.0 bug fixing, and deployment of our Flod CI system
        for all projects.

        Flod CI is now operating on five platforms (more coming soon),
        for every commit on every branch for every project.
        This transition allowed us to decommission several old machines.

        Timewarrior bug fixes are bringing the 1.1.0 release closer. We
        are down to 7 open issues currently needing to be fixed.

        Taskwarrior is undergoing big changes to incorporate the new
        recurrence features. This leads to instability, so if anyone is
        using the 2.6.0 development branch, this would be a good time to
        stop.

        The Taskwarrior 2.6.0 branch has a <code>stable</code> tag which
        indicates the last commit where all tests passed on all platforms.

        The libshared project got a major update to the date and duration
        handling features, fixing bugs and providing a consistent
        implementation for Taskwarrior and Timewarrior to use.

        The team attended FOSDEM
        (https://taskwarrior.org/news/news.20170208.html)
        in Brussels, all meeting for the first time. No one was hurt.
        Although we had hoped to accomplish a lot during this time, we
        instead fell in love with a certain restaurant and Belgian beer.

        We would like to welcome Thomas Lauf, who is now pushing to the
        Timewarrior repository, and Timewarrior is now being fixed and
        improved at a much faster rate. Welcome, Thomas.

        The flod2 CI system is coming online, which means that Taskwarrior
        is now being built in parallel by two CI systems as we prepare for
        a more general transition.

        (Flod  https://central.gothenburgbitfactory.org/task-2.6.0.html)

        A generous donation from DigitalOcean

        The rat parser is now mostly complete, and ready to take on the
        syntax of the rules system.

        The Taskwarrior bug database
        haѕ had another cleanup pass that removed obsolete or
        accidentally fixed issues.

        The flod2 CI system is now online and is about to begin processing
        builds instead of the old flod system. Both system will be online
        until the switchover is complete.

        Finally, the team spent a little time getting ready for FOSDEM.

        A lot of fun!

        We had a great time sharing thoughts and ideas, drinking beer and 
        discussing various topics.

        There are some highlights to share:

        Both Taskwarrior and Taskserver improved GnuTLS support, in
        particular with more robust certificate validation, and error
        reporting/logging.

        The rat parser is now handling complex grammars, such as the
        clog configuration file, and will later be used to handle
        command line parsing in all projects.

        The Taskwarrior overhaul of recurrence features has begun, which
        will culminate in the 2.6.0 release with new types of recurring
        tasks.

        The focus has been on migrating code back to libshared.git, and in
        turn making use of that code. This not only shrinks the size of the
        projects, but means that bug fixes in libshared.git benefit all

        Flod2 is now being rolled out for testing. This is a CI system
        rewrite that eliminates build server daemons and the pull model.
        This will allow greater use of virtual machines, and more
        automation. For example, we will now be able to automatically
        generate coverage reports and snapshot tarballs, based on
        build characteristics.

        release of Timewarrior 1.0.0 and FrOSCon 2016. Focus then shifted
        to finishing up Tasksh 1.1.0 work.

        The main focus for June is getting Timewarrior
        (https://timewarrior.net/docs/index.html)
        ready for an alpha, and subsequent beta release. The purpose of an alpha release is to
        gather feedback that guides the subsequent beta release. Timewarrior
        is a new project that introduces new concepts. This new functionality
        needs to be refined before a beta release.

        The Timewarrior bug tracker (https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/timewarrior/issues)
        is now open for business.

        Additionally the 'libshared' library is being improved.
        This is a Git submodule that nearly all the projects share, and
        helps with code reuse. Most importantly, fixing bugs in 'libshared'
        will fix bugs in all projects, without a lot of manual patching.

        Today we could verify that Taskwarrior works out of the box under "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows 10".
        Either by installing it via apt-get (which pulls the regular Ubuntu package) or by compiling it.
        No changes needed to the source code. You compile it as you would do it on native Ubuntu.  A few
        tests were failing. But no major ones. Enjoy the screenshot and enjoy the thoughts of being able
        to abandon Cygwin soon, if you are using Taskwarrior on Windows.

      <description>
        A task does not require a due date, and can simply be a statement of need:

        $ task add Send Alice a birthday card

        However this is exactly the kind of task can benefit from having a due date,
        and perhaps several other dates also.

        There are several dates that can decorate a task, each with its own meaning
        and effects. You can choose to use some, all or none of these, but like all
        Taskwarrior features, they are there in case your needs require it, but you
        do not pay a performance or friction penalty by not using them.

        Taskwarrior aims to provide a toolkit of various capabilities, which
        can be cherry-picked to support many custom methodologies.

        We have learned over the years that everyone uses it differently,
        and for different things. There is a lot to be learned from how
        someone uses software, the features they use, and the ones they do
        not.

        We’re looking for someone to assume the responsibility of packaging
        Taskwarrior etc for Cygwin.

        Cygwin doesn’t get the care and attention from us that it should.
        We often skip releasing on Cygwin because we don’t have the
        equipment and must borrow it, and furthermore don’t use Cygwin day
        to day, so every package update involves a full install, and it
        takes hours.

        input stream and colorize or suppress the lines. It can also
        decorate the lines with time- or date-stamps.

        After an intense four month effort, which focused mainly on a more
        capable command-line parser, more extension-friendly behavior, and
        significant improvements to testing, Taskwarrior 2.5.0 beta1 is
        now released.

        We are asking you to please build (https://taskwarrior.org/docs/build.html)
        and test this release in your environment.

        This is a major release, with about 1100 code changes and a hundred
        or so bug fixes, but still resulting in a smaller codebase.

      <description>
        After more than a year of improvements, Taskserver 1.1.0 is released.

        This is a major release, with greatly improved setup, security and
        logging, which make this a recommended upgrade.  Changes include:

        Configuration
          * New setup helper script, 'setup_server.bash', which interactively leads the whole setup and configuration process.
          * When hosting, the configured server name is no longer ignored.
          * Taskserver can now be restricted to IPv4 or IPv6.
          * New man page for 'taskdctl'.
          * Server now supports a configuration setting 'trust', which can be either 'strict' or 'allow all', and defaults to 'strict'.

      <description>
        Taskwarrior 2.4.4 is released.

        Although a minor release, there are significant bug fixes
        which make this a recommended upgrade. Changes include:

        * Fixed a problem where the wrong task may be updated, if GC is disabled. This is the primary reason for the release.
        * Fixed a problem where filters including parenthesized tags ('... and (+DUE or +OVERDUE)') were incorrectly handled.
        * 32-bit platform support.
        * The 'obfuscate' configuration setting will hide private data, intended for bug reporting.
        * An early Japanese localization.
        * Several bug fixes.

        For full details, see the ChangeLog file included in the release.

      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2015 23:20:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>
        Taskwarrior 2.4.3 is released. This is primarily a bug fix release
        to address a bad hook problem that prevented on-modify hooks from
        modifying tasks.

        User Defined Attributes (https://taskwarrior.org/docs/udas.html) have
        been enhanced so that type 'string' attributes may now
        designate the sort order of allowed values.  This enhancement permits
        the migration of the 'priority' attribute to a UDA.
        This means you may now define your own priority levels, sorting and
        urgency coefficients.

      <description>
        Taskwarrior supports duration values.  In the core, durations are
        used directly in one place - the 'recur' attribute,
        used for recurring tasks. For example, here is a recurring task
        that recurs every monday:

        $ task add Take out the trash due:monday recur:weekly

        The value 'monday' is interpreted as 'next monday',
        and the value 'weekly' is interpreted as a 7-day
        duration.

      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2015 20:46:43 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>
        To support an evolving Hooks API, Taskwarrior must provide hook
        scripts with a mechanism for determining which version of the
        Hooks API is prividing the context for the script.

        It is anticipated that in future versions, new events will be
        added, and changes to the interfaces will occur. A hook script
        needs to act according to the API version, otherwise it risks
        incompatibility with Taskwarrior.

        The interfaces define what is provided as standard input, and
        what is expected on standard output.  With v2 there
        will also be command line arguments provided to the script.

        perhaps you will learn something new.

        Some of the example are deliberately chosen because there is more than
        one solution, in which case all are presented, for comparison.

        Rackspace has announced that it will reboot all of its cloud server
        infrastructure joining other hosting providers. The data center we are
        hosted in is the third in the row of IAD, DFW and ORD. The announced
        maintenance window is from 2014-09-28 1100 GMT to 2014-09-29 1101 GMT.

        This will cause interruptions here at taskwarrior.org. You can follow

        Taskwarrior 2.4.0 will be released with a fully updated Fish Shell
        completion script, from Roman Inflianskas. Here is a demo gif that
        Roman put together.

        The Fish shell has sophisticated completion capabilities, and this
        update takes full advantage of this.

        Development is shifting focus for Taskwarrior and Taskserver. No
        more features will be added, and completeness, stability and testing
        become the new focus.

        The goal is to work towards good beta releases for Taskwarrior 2.4.0,
        Taskserver 1.1.0 and Tasksh 1.0.0.

        The Taskwarrior 2.4.0 development branch has been unusable for a
        a few weeks
        (https://taskwarrior.org/news/news.20140524.html)
        while new functionality was integrated. It has been a
        long process, with about 750 commits made so far, but now all the
        tests are passing again.

        Taskwarrior 2.4.0 is in development. The main feature of this
        release is a new command line parser, and some related features
        such as expression evaluation and ISO-8601 date support.
        This is a major undertaking, but the reward will be some very nice
        new features.

        Until now this work, on the 2.4.0 branch in the code repository has
        been carefully done so as to not completely break functionality.
        There are currently 24 failing tests, mostly regarding newly added
        capabilities.

        On Saturday May 10th 2014, Dirk Deimeke presented a Taskwarrior
        workshop at Swiss Ubucon
        (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SwissTeam/).

        https://taskwarrior.org/download/task-latest.ref.pdf

        Dirk presented a live demo, with a handout PDF (which we will link
        here soon) that covers every aspect including downloading, building,
        installing, setup, first use, all the way to some of the more
        complex use cases.

        With Taskwarrior version 2.4.0, we are building a better command
        line parser. In addition to fixing a lot of annoying little bugs,
        we would like it to be more flexible and robust. That means it will
        be able to handle more strange inputs than before, but can it do
        better?
