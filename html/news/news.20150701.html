          <p>
            This is an ongoing series of activity reports, published monthly,
            to highlight activity in the Taskwarrior project. Here is what
            happened in June 2015.
          </p>

          <table class="table table-striped table-compact">

              <td>
                Tasksh gains the ability to detect terminal width, and display
                colored banners.

                Tasksh gains a more polished <code>review</code> command, which
                manages a GTD-like review session of your tasks, remembering
                where it left off, and not revisiting tasks too often. With
                upcoming Taskwarrior enhancements, this feature will be
                functional.

                A JSON parser memory leak was fixed, which is likely the cause
                of the long-standing non-linear performance of the parser.

                The sin of modifying a task to depend on another, when it
                already does so, has been downgraded from error to NOP.

                The unit test framework gains more capabilities, and more tests
                are migrated from Perl to Python. Why are we migrating? 
                There are two main reason to move to Python: there is more
                enthusiasm for Python in the community, and our Python test
                framework is gaining some very powerful features. One in
                particular is the degree of isolation between test scripts,
                which is allowing us to parallelize the test suite. Although
                we could easily improve the Perl framework, we have decided not
                to.

                The test framework gains the ability to do some very suspicious
                things like test the <code>task edit</code> feature. Magic.

                The command line parser, the darkest, most disturbing part of
                Taskwarrior, begins to be beaten into shape. First up: clean up
                the worst of the cruft.

                The <code>project</code> verbosity token now implies the
                <code>footnote</code> token. This is the beginning of a more
                sensible cascading mechanism for verbosity.

                The unit test suite, with shocking honesty, now declares tests
                as not expected to pass, rather than commenting them out and
                pretending they don't exist. It's becoming harder to lie about
                features working.

                Once again, there are two command line parsers in Taskwarrior,
                the current one, and a new shadow parser that will grow to
                become better than the current one, ultimately replace it.
                Why are we doing this?
                <ol>
                  <li>Parsers are fun!</li>
                  <li>Destabilizing code is exciting</li>

                The test suite now recognizes cases where tests pass, but were
                expected to fail, and flags this. Prior to this, these cases
                were hard to spot.

                <code>cmake</code> option <code>-DENABLE_SYNC=OFF</code> is
                specified. There have just been too many folks installing
                binary packages with no sync capability, that then need to
                builds from source. That's just cruel.

                The test suite overhaul, and
                Python conversion
                is now at the point where <em>most</em> of the tests are no

                The test suite overhaul continues, and the old <code>--fast</code>
                option is now the default, and the whole test suite runs in under
                twenty seconds (on this arbitrary piece of hardward), because
                of parallelization. The <code>run_all</code> and
                <code>problems</code> scripts are updated with more details,
                options and easy-to-interpret color. The test suite is becoming
                a much more powerful debugging tool.

                Taskwarrior loses support for ambiguous ISO-8601 date formats,
                such as <code>YYYYMMDD</code> and <code>hhmmss</code> for time.
                This leaves the clearer extended forms (<code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>
                and <code>hh:mm:ss</code>) intact, and the old forms still
                available via <code>rc.dateformat</code>. This reduces command
                line parser ambiguity - a good thing.

                For years now, deleting a task has generated feedback that says
                it is 'permanently' removed. This it not true, especially with
