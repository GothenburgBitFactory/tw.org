                <p>
                  Timewarrior 1.1.0 is released. With 18 months of updates, many
                  bugs fixed, and new convenience features added, Timewarrior 1.1.0 is
                  stable and ready.

                <p>
                  Timewarrior tracks your time from the command line and generates
                  reports. Your data is stored locally in clear text. It integrates well
                  with Taskwarrior.

                  April was a relatively quiet month, but with two main efforts:
                  Timewarrior 1.1.0 bug fixing, and deployment of our Flod CI system
                  for all projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Flod CI is now operating on five platforms (more coming soon),
                  for every commit on every branch for every project.
                  This transition allowed us to decommission several old machines.

                  Taskwarrior is undergoing big changes to incorporate the new
                  recurrence features. This leads to instability, so if anyone is
                  using the 2.6.0 development branch, this would be a good time to
                  stop.

                  The Taskwarrior 2.6.0 branch has a <code>stable</code> tag which

                  Flod2 is now being rolled out for testing. This is a CI system
                  rewrite that eliminates build server daemons and the pull model.
                  This will allow greater use of virtual machines, and more
                  automation. For example, we will now be able to automatically
                  generate coverage reports and snapshot tarballs, based on
                  build characteristics.

                  Additionally the <code>libshared</code> library is being improved.
                  This is a Git submodule that nearly all the projects share, and
                  helps with code reuse. Most importantly, fixing bugs in <code>libshared</code>
                  will fix bugs in all projects, without a lot of manual patching.

                <p>
                  Today we could verify that Taskwarrior works out of the box under "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows 10".
                  Either by installing it via apt-get (which pulls the regular Ubuntu package) or by compiling it.
                  No changes needed to the source code. You compile it as you would do it on native Ubuntu.  A few
                  tests were failing. But no major ones. Enjoy the screenshot and enjoy the thoughts of being able
                  to abandon Cygwin soon, if you are using Taskwarrior on Windows.

                <p>
                  Cygwin doesn’t get the care and attention from us that it should.
                  We often skip releasing on Cygwin because we don’t have the
                  equipment and must borrow it, and furthermore don’t use Cygwin day
                  to day, so every package update involves a full install, and it
                  takes hours.

                  Taskwarrior 2.4.3 is released. This release contains the Hooks API v2,

                  User Defined Attributes (<a href="/docs/udas.html">UDAs</a>) have
                  been enhanced so that type <code>string</code> attributes may now
                  designate the sort order of allowed values.  This enhancement permits
                  the migration of the <code>priority</code> attribute to a UDA.
                  This means you may now define your own priority levels, sorting and
                  urgency coefficients.

                  long process, with about 750 commits made so far, but now all the
                  tests are passing again.

                <p>
                  Does this mean it's ready for alpha and beta? No, not yet, because
                  now there is a need for a lot of new tests to cover all the new
                  functionality. This is the next phase of cycle, improving tests,
                  fixing open bugs, and updating documentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Taskwarrior 2.4.0 is in development. The main feature of this
                  release is a new command line parser, and some related features
                  such as expression evaluation and ISO-8601 date support.
                  This is a major undertaking, but the reward will be some very nice
                  new features.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Until now this work, on the 2.4.0 branch in the code repository has
                  been carefully done so as to not completely break functionality.
                  There are currently 24 failing tests, mostly regarding newly added
                  capabilities.

                  Dirk presented a live demo, with a handout PDF (which we will link
                  here soon) that covers every aspect including downloading, building,
                  installing, setup, first use, all the way to some of the more
                  complex use cases.

                <p>
                  With Taskwarrior version 2.4.0, we are building a better command
                  line parser. In addition to fixing a lot of annoying little bugs,
                  we would like it to be more flexible and robust. That means it will
                  be able to handle more strange inputs than before, but can it do
                  better?
